Under normal physiologic conditions, this process is localized to the site of injury and is rapid, dynamic, and highly regulated. Phases of this response include initial formation of the platelet plug following endothelial injury, activation of the coagulation cascade for further hemostatic control, regulation of coagulation by endogenous anticoagulants to limit thrombus formation, and finally, fibrinolysis for thrombus removal.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 96-1. <span class="s5">Thrombus formation may occur at areas of endothelial or vascular wall injury.

Following activation by collagen, laminin, microfibrils, and other elements in the exposed subendothelium, platelets are activated and bind to von Willebrand factor (VWF) and fibrinogen via the platelet glycoprotein 1b- alpha and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (also referred as integrin αIIbβ<span class="s11">3</span>), respectively. This leads to enhanced platelet adhesion and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aggregation, resulting in a platelet plug.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Coagulation Cascade</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the clotting cascade is a complex series of pathways, several key events are briefly reviewed here. Classically, the coagulation cascade has been divided into the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, as illustrated in <span class="s1">Figure 96-2</span>. In recent years, investigators have proposed a cell-based model of coagulation that occurs on the cell surface in four overlapping steps: (1) initiation, (2) amplification, (3) propagation, and (4) termination (<span class="s1">Table 96- 1</span>). The primary event for initiation of the clotting cascade and subsequent thrombus formation is interactions of activated factor VII (FVIIa) with exposed tissue factor, an integral membrane glycoprotein, at areas of endothelial or tissue injury. The TF-FVIIa complex (also known as the extrinsic tenase complex) then activates factor IX (FIX) and factor X (FX).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Activated factor X (FXa) converts a small amount of factor II (FII, also known as prothrombin) to thrombin (FIIa). The small amount of thrombin generated during the initiation phase then activates platelets, factor V (FV), factor VIII (FVIII), and factor XI (FXI) (amplification phase). During the propagation phase, activated FXI (FXIa) generates activated FIX (FIXa), which binds to activated (FVIIIa) to form the intrinsic tenase complex. This complex (FIXa:FVIIIa) results in large production of FXa, which in combination with its cofactor, FVa, forms the prothrombinase complex (FXa:FVa), which cleaves prothrombin to thrombin. The efficiency of both the intrinsic tenase complex and prothrombinase complex is enhanced by their co-localization on the surface of activated platelets recruited to the site of endothelial or tissue injury, resulting in a burst of thrombin formation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thrombin then converts fibrinogen to fibrin and overlapping fibrin strands are cross-linked and stabilized by activated factor XIII (FXIIIa).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:47.2pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>KEY PHASES OF THE CELL-BASED MODEL OF COAGULATION<span class="s21">A</span></p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 96-2. <span class="s5">The clotting cascade is a complex series of pathways and key events. The coagulation cascade may be divided into the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and, in parallel, also considered in the context of a cell-based model of coagulation that occurs on the cell surface in four sequential phases, as illustrated on the left side of this panel and described in Table 96-1: (1) initiation, (2) amplification, (3) propagation, and (4) termination. The primary event for initiation of the extrinsic pathway is the interaction between activated factor VII (FVIIa) and exposed tissue factor (TF), often at areas of endothelial or tissue injury. The intrinsic pathway begins with activation of factor XII, driving subsequent activation of factors XI, IX, and X. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways result in the conversion of prothrombin (FII) to thrombin (FIIa), in the final common pathway. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and overlapping fibrin strands are cross-linked and stabilized by activated factor XIII (FXIIIa), resulting in stable thrombus formation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><ul id="l16"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Understand how aging alters hemostatic pathways to increase the risk of both bleeding and thrombosis.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Review the evaluation of older adults with bleeding disorders.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Understand the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in older adults.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Review the strategies to reduce bleeding risk in older adults on anticoagulation.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><div class="textbox" style="border:1.5pt solid #D46B38;display:block;min-height:249.0pt;width:456.0pt;"><p class="s249" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><ol id="l17"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">The risk of bleeding rises with age and is most commonly due to acquired bleeding disorders and disorders of platelet number or function.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">Aging is associated with an increased risk of VTE.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are safe and effective in carefully selected older adults for the treatment of VTE.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">A careful consideration of the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation in older adults is integral to the selection and management of oral anticoagulants in this high-risk population.</p></li></ol></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Endogenous anticoagulants, including antithrombin (AT), protein C, protein S, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), act to limit coagulation at the site of injury.
