Thus, in a sense, a conceptual checklist is presented in which a four-way interaction of various factors can be systematically considered when making decisions.

However, it has been difficult to identify biological measurements that accurately reflect individual’s physiological or functional age. Many biomarkers of aging have been studied, although no single biomarker or combination of biomarkers has been sensitive or specific enough to accurately assess the physiologic aging process.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The most widely studied biomarkers of aging have been markers of inflammation. Aging is associated with increased levels of circulating cytokines and proinflammatory markers. Age-related changes in the immune system, that is, immunosenescence, and increased secretion of cytokines by adipose tissue, can lead to a state of chronic inflammation or “inflammaging.” High levels of IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein in older adults are associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In particular, cohort studies in older subjects have indicated that increased TNF-α and IL-6 levels are associated with frailty as well as several cancer- related symptom complexes including cachexia, fatigue, poor performance status, and cognitive issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Markers of cellular senescence, such as p16INKa, a component of the cell cycle, has been shown to increase with chronological age and chemotherapy exposure in patients with breast cancer. This may represent a promising biomarker that links aging, cancer, and cancer treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Epigenetic age or clock, an estimation of biological age using DNA- methylation based biomarkers, may also be an important assessment of biological aging in cancer. Individuals with epigenetic age that surpasses their chronological age have an increased risk of all-cause mortality, even after adjusting for other risk factors. However, more research is needed, to enhance our understanding of biological measures of aging that are clinically meaningful, reliable, and feasible to obtain in older patients with cancer.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Markers of Aging</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the absence of an easily measurable or precise marker of aging, clinical tools remain the gold standard for evaluating an individual’s functional and physiologic status in older patients with cancer. The multidimensional CGA (as described in detail in <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 8</span>) has been demonstrated to be feasible in both daily clinical practice and oncology clinical trials, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) have all recommended performing a CGA in all older patients with cancer receiving systemic therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Traditionally in oncology, performance status (PS) is used as an attempt to quantify cancer patients’ general well-being and is also utilized to determine whether they can receive chemotherapy. The most commonly used measure, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS runs from 0 to 5, with 0 denoting perfect health and 5, death. However, in the geriatric oncology population, it has been demonstrated that ECOG PS alone is not sufficient, and CGA adds substantial information to the functional assessment of older cancer patients, including patients with a good ECOG PS.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The CGA has proved very useful in assessing the functional age of an older adult. It can uncover problems that would not otherwise be identified by routine history and physical or by the traditional oncology performance status tools. A CGA comprises several domains, including functional status, comorbidities that may interfere with cancer therapy, nutritional status, polypharmacy, psychological and cognitive status, socioeconomic issues, and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">geriatric syndromes. The CGA identifies clinically significant aging-related problems, such as risk for falls and cognitive impairment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The CGA can identify patients age 65 or older at increased risk of experiencing chemotherapy toxicity. In one study, by the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG), geriatric assessment variables along with sociodemographics, tumor/treatment variables, and laboratory test results were incorporated into a model that would predict for chemotherapy toxicity in older adults. This model identified older adults at low (0–5 points; 30%), intermediate (6–9 points; 52%), or high risk (10–19 points; 83%) of chemotherapy toxicity (<i>p </i>&lt; 0.001). In another study the Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients (CRASH) determined that patients with low-risk scores had only a 7% chance of hematologic and 33% chance of nonhematologic toxicity compared to high-risk patients, who had a 100% risk of hematologic and 93% risk of nonhematologic toxicity from chemotherapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">To identify patients who are likely to benefit from undergoing a CGA, a series of screening instruments have been designed and evaluated in older cancer patients as listed in <span class="s1">Table 88-2</span>. These screening tools can be easily performed by health care providers in a busy clinical setting. A complete assessment can be performed after screening and one that is increasingly being used in North America in clinical trials performed by cooperative groups, includes measures reflecting the domains of a CGA. The geriatric assessment tool primarily consisted of self-reported measures, which were completed by the patient. Three items were completed by the health care professional. The median time to complete the CGA tool was 22 minutes, and 87% of patients completed their portion without assistance.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 88-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>COMPARISONS OF VARIOUS SCREENING COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT (CGA) METHODOLOGIES</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CGA-Guided Interventions</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although high-quality data support the use of the CGA to identify geriatric syndromes and to predict mortality and chemotherapy toxicity, evidence supporting the implementation of CGA-guided processes for informing cancer treatment has been limited. Recent randomized clinical trials have assessed the effectiveness of CGA-guided interventions for older adults with cancer. In one study, a cluster randomized controlled trial in community practices, investigators analyzed the effect of providing oncologists CGA- guided recommendations on treatment-related toxicity in patients aged 70 or older with advanced cancers and at least one geriatric deficit or syndrome.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forty-one practices, which included 718 patients, were randomized to the CGA intervention or to usual oncologist-directed care alone. Findings revealed that the intervention arm had an absolute reduction in toxicity of 20% when compared with the usual care arm. Another study, a single-center randomized controlled trial, examined the effect of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) CGA-guided intervention on treatment-related toxicity in patients 65 years or older with solid tumors (any stage) starting a new line of chemotherapy. Patients in the intervention arm underwent a CGA that was then reviewed by the MDT, which implemented tailored interventions. In the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">usual care arm, the treating oncologist received the CGA results, but no interventions were implemented. In the 620 patients randomized, a 10% reduction in chemotherapy toxicity was observed in the intervention arm compared with the usual care arm. These studies demonstrate that CGA- guided interventions can in fact lead to decreased treatment toxicity and improve key outcomes for older patients with cancer. However, more effort is needed to address the barriers to widespread implementation of geriatric oncology care, including health care system-level organizational issues, lack of time, limited staffing, lack of training and familiarity with available tools, and unclear reimbursement rules.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MAJOR THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surgery</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surgery and other invasive procedures are frequently involved in initial diagnostic as well as in therapeutic approaches to the older adult with cancer. An increased number of comorbid medical conditions, decreased wound healing, and lack of physiologic reserve contribute to both prolonged hospital stay and rehabilitation following operative treatment. All phases of healing are compromised by the aging process. Both the inflammatory and proliferative responses are decreased, remodeling occurs to a lesser degree, and the collagen formed is qualitatively different from that in younger individuals. Normally, the repair process initiated by inflammation requires intact sensory nerves that stimulate increased blood flow and growth factor production. The loss of sensory neurons and the coexistence of other medical conditions, such as diabetes and vascular disease, contribute to delayed wound healing. Additionally, complications are more common when surgical intervention is performed on an emergency basis. Often, it is more appropriate to perform an operation as a preventive measure when dealing with older populations; for example, a hemicolectomy may be performed— even for patients with advanced colorectal cancer—to prevent the need for an emergency operation to treat bowel perforation or obstruction.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Increasingly CGA and geriatric comanagement are being applied to the evaluation and preparation of older patients for surgery as well as to guide postoperative management. Geriatric comanagement can lead to improved 90-day postoperative mortality. The American Geriatrics Society Task Force and the American College of Surgeons provide general guidelines for older</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adults undergoing surgery and these may be applied to older patients with cancer undergoing surgery.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radiation Therapy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radiation therapy (RT) can be used in the older adults with cancer with both curative and palliative intent. RT is also used as an effective adjunct to surgery or chemotherapy or both. The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Task Force has put forth guidelines for best practices in radiation oncology in older adults. Per these guidelines, patient selection should include comorbidity and geriatric evaluation. In older adults with breast cancer, shorter courses of hypofractionated whole breast RT are safe and effective. In patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), conformal radiotherapy and involved field techniques without elective nodal irradiation have improved outcomes without increasing toxicity. If comorbidities preclude surgery, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an option for early stage NSCLC and pancreatic cancer. For patients with lymphoma, involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) may be based on pretreatment positron emission tomography (PET) data to reduce toxicity. For patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 4 to 6 months of hormonal therapy combined with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) may be an option. Short- course EBRT is an alternative to combined modality therapy in older patients with rectal cancer without significant comorbidities. Endorectal RT may be an option for early stage disease. For primary brain tumors shorter courses of postoperative RT following maximal debulking provides equivalent survival to longer schedules. Stereotactic RT provides an alternative to whole-brain RT in patients with limited brain metastases. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy provides an excellent technique to reduce dose to the carotids in head and neck cancer and improves locoregional control in esophageal cancer. It is crucial to monitor older patients receiving radiation since the effects of radiation on normal tissue may be enhanced by 10% to 15% in the older patient. Radiation to the oral pharynx and oral cavity can produce a loss of taste, dryness of mucous membranes, and involution of salivary glands, which when combined with a precarious nutritional intake in a frail and older individual might be lethal, or certainly contribute a considerable amount of morbidity, if not recognized. Moreover, if daily treatment is tolerated poorly, owing to nausea or weakness, treatment may be compromised because of the decreased daily doses, the patient’s</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unscheduled absences, or decrease in the total planned dose. Pulmonary complications such as severe radiation pneumonitis have been noted to occur more frequently in older adults with lung cancer versus younger patients, regardless of radiation field size and concurrent therapies. Depression, disabling fatigue, and cognitive decline are potential side effects of whole- brain RT.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Systemic Therapy</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Chemothe rapy </span>A thorough discussion of the principles of pharmacology in older adults can be found in <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 22</span>. Although still understudied, in recent years there have been more direct studies of the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of orally or parenterally administered chemotherapeutic agents. Changes in organ function with age and the declining ability of senescent cells to repair DNA damage increase the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-related toxicity. For example, increased destruction of and lower numbers of rapidly renewing mucosal stem cells increase susceptibility to mucositis. Reduced hematopoietic stem cell reserve may both worsen the severity and slow recovery of cytopenias.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">When oral agents are used, despite delayed gastric emptying, absorption is adequate but one must pay attention to concomitant medications like H<span class="s11">2</span> blockers, antacids, and proton pump inhibitors. Caution must be exercised</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">when administering cytotoxic drugs like methotrexate, bleomycin, cisplatin,</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and ifosfamide. Both decreases in the number of nephrons and a decline in the glomerular filtration rate may contribute to excess toxicity. Also, there is a decrease in lean body mass in the older adult, thus, adjusting the dose based on a creatinine clearance and not merely the creatinine is very important. In addition, concomitant administration of drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may compromise renal function. Although the reasons are unclear, acute toxicities like nausea and vomiting occur less frequently in older patients; however, the lack of functional reserve can lead to catastrophic outcomes quickly, that is, dehydration and renal insufficiency. Neurotoxicity secondary to taxanes, platinum agents, vincristine, high-dose cytarabine, and bortezomib; cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin; and mucositis from 5-fluorouracil are all more common and severe in older patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Despite this knowledge, there is a persistent lack of prospective data for older patients, particularly for those patients older than 80 years, in cancer treatment clinical trials. However, the SIOG Task Force has published</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">guidelines for dose modification of chemotherapy in older patients with renal insufficiency and has reviewed the use of certain classes of drugs: alkylators, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, taxanes, camptothecins, and epipodophyllotoxins. As described previously, a CGA is helpful when incorporated with other parameters to predict for the risk of toxicity in older adults.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hormonal the rapy <span class="p">Older women are more likely to have ER-positive tumors and approximately 70% to 80% of all breast tumors in older patients express ER. Thus, tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole and letrozole have been used widely in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic setting. These drugs each have their own side effects. The well-known higher risk of thromboembolic events and cerebrovascular accidents reported with tamoxifen should be taken into account when proposing this treatment to a patient already suffering from severe peripheral venous insufficiency, hypertension, and/or atrial fibrillation. On the other hand, because of the increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures with aromatase inhibitors, fracture risk should be assessed and recommendation with regard to exercise and calcium/vitamin D supplementation given. Bone-directed therapy should be given to all patients with a T score less than −2.0 standard deviations (SD), or with a T score less than −1.5 SD with one additional risk factor, or with two or more risk factors (without bone mineral density). Androgen- deprivation therapy with luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and antiandrogens is used in older men with prostate cancer. Side effects of impotence, breast tenderness, hot flashes, osteoporosis, and memory decline are common with these agents.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Targeted Therapies</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There has been an exponential increase in both the approval and use of targeted therapeutic agents in the past decade due to “precision medicine.” Precision medicine aims to target a specific genetic alteration with a specific drug. This tailored approach includes many drugs that are oral including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, drugs targeted to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and BRAF- mutation targeted drugs. While, there have not been dedicated clinical trials for use among older adults, the data have been extrapolated from larger trials in which older patients generally were a fraction of the participants. Many of these agents are orally administered, and older patients with comorbidities</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">often are on many other medications, which may be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 liver enzymes. Thus, the treating oncologist, geriatrician, and primary care physician should be aware and prepare for significant drug interactions when these new agents are taken concomitantly with P450 inhibitors or inducers. One study has demonstrated that comorbidities and polypharmacy impacted cytogenetic response rates in older adults with chronic myeloid leukemia being treated with imatinib. In addition, while these drugs have a favorable safety profile compared to parenteral chemotherapy, there is still a risk of toxicity, leading to a higher rate of dose reduction and discontinuation among older versus younger patients.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Immunotherapy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Immunotherapy is one of the newest treatments that has revolutionized cancer care. Immunotherapy uses the body’s own immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. Cancer cells manipulate immune checkpoints evading cell death. One of the main types of immunotherapy are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs, eg, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, atezolizumab). ICIs block the checkpoint between the tumor cells and regulatory T cells that would result in downregulation of activated T cells, thereby upregulating T- cell activity. ICIs treat many cancer types including melanoma and lung, bladder, colorectal, and renal cell carcinoma, among others. While there are many new ICIs available, clinical trials predominantly include younger and the most healthy adults, limiting the generalizability of outcomes to older adults. The most common side effects are fatigue, rash, itching, diarrhea, and elevated liver function tests. One main issue is the occurrence of immune- related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs can affect almost every organ in the body due to dysregulation of the immune system causing colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, rash, thyroiditis, arthritis, myocarditis, and hypophysitis among others. While some irAEs can be mild, a subset can be severe requiring high- dose steroids and hospitalizations. Due to a proinflammatory aging host environment, termed “inflammaging”, the concern is that older adults are at higher risk for irAEs. Recent data demonstrate equivalent incidence of high- grade irAEs, but worse overall survival among older adults regardless of cancer type who experience high-grade irAEs versus young adults with metastatic cancer. This may be due to side effects from the treatment of high- grade irAEs (steroids and hospitalization), which are often much less tolerated in older adults. Though a potential risk, the use of immunotherapy in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">general is producing durable long-term survival for some patients with advanced cancer.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a widely utilized treatment modality for high-risk hematologic malignancies. Historically, the associated morbidity and mortality limited the use of allogeneic SCT to individuals age less than 50. However, autologous SCT for lymphoma and myeloma has been performed in fit patients older than 70 years. There are no guidelines for HSCT in older adults so, patient selection, choice of conditioning regimen, immunosuppression, stem cell source is arbitrary and may be based on cardiopulmonary and hepatorenal function. Risk-assessment tools such as a CGA, and comorbidity measures have recently been applied to facilitate decisions regarding HSCT eligibility and tolerance. Reduced- intensity conditioning (RIC) for allogeneic HCT, has led to improved tolerance and decreased mortality and removed traditional age barriers. RIC regimens may vary in the degree of immunosuppression and myeloablation and transplant-related mortality is typically lower than myeloablative approaches. Another important issue is donor selection for older recipients. Older patients tend to have older human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings, raising issues about the upper age or health limitations for donor collection since older donor age slightly diminishes hematopoietic stem cell yields. Numerous other geriatric domains such as nutrition, caregiver support, and cognitive assessment have not been evaluated in the setting of HSCT. For example, delirium occurs in up to 50% of allogeneic HSCT recipients and likely more often among older adults and needs further study.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative and Supportive Care</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative care focuses on providing patients with relief from the symptoms caused by the cancer itself or cancer treatment with the goal of improving quality of life for both the patient and caregiver. Older adults frequently underreport their symptoms, which requires routine and early symptom assessment by the treating cancer team. In fact, routine symptom assessment and intervention can improve overall survival upwards of 5 months without any change to cancer treatment. Many of the specific aspects of supportive care are covered in other chapters and are only mentioned here to stress its importance in the comprehensive management of the older adults with cancer.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These include the extreme importance of effective pain management (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 68</span>); maintenance of appropriate nutritional support (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 32</span>); the supportive role of nursing (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 14</span>); the importance of patient, physician, and family discussions regarding end-of-life care and other issues (Chapters 67, 71, and 72); and the utility of hospice care (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 70</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Nausea and vomiting </span>One complication frequently seen in treatment of the older adult with cancer is nausea and vomiting. These side effects can seriously compromise the ability to deliver effective chemotherapy, but also cause significant morbidity (eg, dehydration and renal insufficiency). All older adults on chemotherapy should focus on hydration and environmental factors, such as food and other odors that may trigger vomiting. Patients can try eating smaller portions of food but more frequently to meet caloric needs and drinking clear, cooler beverages. Patients can try saltier rather than sweet foods and those that are low in fat for easier digestion. Antiemetic drugs have improved substantially and are routinely given for all types of chemotherapy, many types of oral targeted treatments, radiation depending on location, and surgery. Corticosteroids are a useful adjunct to most antiemetic regimens that include benzamides (eg, metoclopramide), butyrophenones (eg, haloperidol), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), and serotonin (5HT<span class="s11">3</span>)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">antagonists such as ondansetron, palonosetron, and dolasetron. One recent study evaluated the comparative efficacy and tolerability of palonosetron and ondansetron/dolasetron in a retrospective post hoc analysis using pooled data from 171 older adults (age ≥ 65) with cancer enrolled in two randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical studies comparing single intravenous doses of these antiemetic agents given prior to receipt of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Palonosetron was more effective in controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avoidance of constipation is also a key component of both prevention and management of nausea and vomiting. Chemotherapeutic drugs like vincristine, vinblastine, thalidomide, and opioids can also cause severe obstipation necessitating a good bowel regimen with stool softeners and laxatives.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pain <span class="p">Cancer-related pain is experienced by 50% to 90% of patients with advanced disease and in about 60% to 70% patients who are receiving active treatment for their tumors. The Hospitalized Elderly Longitudinal Project (HELP) showed that one out of three patients in this study died in</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">severe pain. Older patients are at risk for undertreatment of pain because of underestimation of their sensitivity to pain, the expectation that they tolerate pain well, and misconception about their ability to benefit from the use of opioids. The approach to pain management in older adults described in <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 68 </span>can be applied to the older patient with cancer. Comprehensive geriatric care involving other geriatric team members and palliative care early, demonstrates not only improved pain management and symptom control but also improved survival. Moreover, an educational intervention (patients watched a 14-minute video that presented information on “Managing Cancer Pain” aimed at older patients with cancer) was effective in prevention and management of cancer pain in older adults.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Fatigue </span>This is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms from cancer and cancer treatment. It significantly affects a patient’s quality of life. In one systematic review, the prevalence of fatigue was 40% to 90% during treatment and 19% to 80% after completion of treatment. The etiology of fatigue is multifold ranging from immobility and deconditioning, to anemia, depression, pain, poor nutrition, drugs, and metabolic causes. Treatment of fatigue is to treat the underlying cause if found, for example, treat anemia as appropriate with hematinics, iron, B<span class="s11">12</span>, folate, transfusions. There are both</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. Pharmacologic interventions include antidepressants and stimulants such as modafinil, corticosteroids, or methylphenidate. More commonly, nonpharmacologic interventions are used such as psychosocial interventions, exercise, sleep therapy, and acupuncture. Though counter- intuitive, increasing physical activity and exercise programs is one of the most effective treatments for cancer-related fatigue. Additional research is needed to treat cancer-related fatigue particularly among older adults.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anxiety and depression</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of depression among patients with cancer is between 17% and 25%. Patients at greatest risk are those with lung cancer, older age, unmarried men, women with severe illness, poor performance and functional status, and advanced cancer. Among patients with cancer, there is a strong relationship between pain and depression. Before making the diagnosis in older adults, it is important to exclude other causes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">We recommend checking thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), B<span class="s11">12</span>, calcium, and liver function tests. For depression treatment, selective serotonin</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reuptake inhibitors like citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline are first-line choice of drugs in older adults, especially if patients have ischemic heart disease or conduction heart defects, prostatic hypertrophy, or uncontrolled glaucoma. Venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and bupropion are considered second-line drugs. However, for patients with cancer, mirtazapine is useful for mood, appetite, and sleep with minimal side effects. Nortriptyline or desipramine are used as third-line drugs and for severe melancholic depression and they can be difficult to tolerate because of side effects or, in the case of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, because of dietary and medication restrictions.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anorexia and cancer cachexia <span class="p">An older adult’s nutritional status can be compromised in direct response to tumor-induced alterations in metabolism. Cachexia is characterized by advanced protein-calorie malnutrition, involuntary weight loss, muscle wasting, and decreased quality of life.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tumor-induced weight loss occurs frequently in patients with solid tumors of the lung, pancreas, and upper gastrointestinal tract and less often in patients with breast cancer or lower gastrointestinal cancer. Conditions that may cause poor intake and that can be easily treated—gastritis, constipation, oral candidiasis, pain, and nausea—should be treated. Several agents have been tried in clinical trials (not specifically in older patient) to stimulate the patient’s appetite. These include oral corticosteroids, progestational agents like megestrol acetate, cannabinoids like dronabinol, antidepressants like mirtazapine, olanzapine, and omega-3-fatty acids. Anorexia and cachexia are common among dying patients. For family members, accepting their loved one is not eating is often difficult because it means accepting that the patient is dying. It is important to educate family members in advance that if a patient is close to death, neither food nor hydration is necessary to maintain the patient’s comfort. Intravenous fluids, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and tube feedings do not prolong the life of dying patients, and in fact may even increase discomfort and hasten death. Adverse effects of artificial nutrition in dying patients can include pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, edema, and pain associated with inflammation. Conversely, dehydration and ketosis due to caloric restriction correlate with analgesic effects and absence of discomfort. The only reported discomfort due to dehydration near death is xerostomia, which can be prevented and relieved with oral swabs or ice chips.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Survivorship</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are in the midst of an unprecedented increase in the number of older adults diagnosed with, and surviving from, cancer. By 2030, 70% of patients with cancer will be 65 years or older, and the cancer incidence in this group will increase nearly 70% from 2010 to 2030. There are 16 million cancer survivors in the United States, and approximately 60% are age 65 or older. By 2040, it is estimated that the number of cancer survivors will grow to 26 million, with 73% age 65 or older and almost 50% age 75 or older. Despite this substantial growth in the number of older adult cancer survivors, there are many knowledge gaps regarding how cancer and cancer treatment impact the aging process.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In some individuals, cancer and its treatments contribute to an accelerated or accentuated aging phenotype. The majority of these data come from pediatric literature, where cancer survivors are predisposed to the development of frailty and comorbid conditions, such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart, compared to their peers without a history of cancer. There is a smaller yet growing body of literature pointing toward similar findings in the geriatric population. Compared to adults without a history of cancer, older cancer survivors are more likely to report physical and mental health-related quality of life. Cancer and cancer treatments are associated with second malignancies and late effects that can affect any organ system. Given that older cancer survivors are more likely to have limitations in performing activities of daily living, mobility limitations, and increased number of comorbidities, it is imperative to understand the aging-related consequences of cancer and cancer treatments. Strategies such as exercise, diet, nutrition, therapies targeting immune senescence, and supportive care interventions are under further investigation to examine their potential to address the long-term effects of cancer and cancer treatment.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Caregiver Assessment and Interventions</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Older adults with cancer often require additional care at home. In the United States, 63% of home care for older adults with cancer is provided by informal caregivers, who are often family members, and as the population ages, the number of informal caregiver is expected to increase. Caregivers of older adults with cancer tend to be older, with studies showing that nearly 40% have comorbidities and are likely to report their health as fair or poor. These caregivers experience substantial physical and emotional challenges</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">leading to increased caregiver burden. Compared with non-caregivers of the same age, caregivers of older adults with cancer are more likely to experience deterioration in physical health, report symptoms of anxiety and depression, and to have poor health-related behaviors (including decreased exercise, sleep, and poor eating habits). Moreover, caregiver burden is associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients as well as increased risk of hospitalizations and inappropriate end-of-life care.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CONCLUSION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cancer is the leading cause of death in men and women aged 60 to 79 years. The biology of certain tumors is different in older versus younger adults. In addition, older patients have a lower physiologic reserve with decreased tolerance to intensive chemotherapy or other modalities of cancer treatment. Chronological age is not a reliable estimate of life expectancy, functional reserve, or risk of treatment-related complications. A CGA is increasingly being utilized in clinical trials of several tumor types and aids in decision- making and prediction of chemotherapy toxicity, and should be incorporated in the care of older adults with cancer. The patient and their caregivers should continue discussions with the treating oncologist with respect to goals of care throughout the course of their disease.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Aunan J, Cho W, Soreide K.

Moreover, current US incidence and mortality data show that 12.8% of all women (1 in 8) will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime and that 2.6% (1 in 39) will die from it.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The incidence of breast cancer, like most other human cancers, increases dramatically with age. In the United States the median age at which breast cancer is diagnosed is 62 years and the median age of dying from breast cancer is 69, with highest percent of breast cancer deaths occurring between ages 65 and 74. National Vital Statistics indicate that the dramatic increase in incidence and mortality with age (<span class="s1">Figure 89-1</span>) from an invasive breast cancer rate of approximately 1 in 5000 in women aged 15 to 39 to about 1 in 200 in women aged 64 to 74. Of equal concern, although breast cancer– related mortality has been decreasing for several decades, older age has been associated with a lower breast cancer–specific survival rates (<span class="s1">Figure 89-2</span>), possibly reflecting less screening or poorer treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 89-1. </span>Breast cancer incidence and mortality rates by age.

Although breast cancer is more common in older</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">women, they are less likely to be appropriately screened, more likely to present for care at a more advanced stage, more likely to receive inferior surgical and postoperative management, and are less likely to be entered into clinical trials. This has resulted in older breast cancer patients sharing less in the dramatic decline in breast cancer mortality rates in the last two decades as compared with younger women.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The specific cause of breast cancer is unknown. Many factors associated with increased risk have been identified. These include the following: increasing age, family history of breast cancer (especially in a first-degree relative) or known genetic predisposition, early menarche, late age at birth of first child (older than 30 years), late menopause, dense breast tissue, history of benign breast disease (hyperplasia or atypical hyperplasia), heavy radiation exposure, obesity, high endogenous hormone levels (postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy), moderate-to-excessive alcohol use, and possibly cigarette smoking history. Most of these factors are associated with relative risks in the range of 1.1 to greater than 4 times the risk in the general population.

Other, rarer mutations are also associated with breast cancer that include <i>ATM, TP53, PTEN</i>, and <i>CHEK2</i>. In addition to inherited disease-causing genetic variations, there are many modifying factors, including genetic, hormonal, and environmental, that may determine whether a genetic mutation will lead to cancer.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Most breast cancers originate from ductal epithelium. Comparisons of older and younger patients with breast cancer reveal that infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most common histologic type in both groups, accounting for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">75% to 80% of cases, with lobular carcinoma accounting for approximately 5% to 10% and other subtypes accounting for the remaining cancers.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Compared to younger patients, older patients are more likely to be well differentiated and moderately differentiated, be estrogen and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive (60%–70% of patients), have lower rates of tumor proliferation (the number of cells synthesizing deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]), and less frequently express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene. These data suggest that breast cancer in older patients is biologically less aggressive than it is in younger women.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mortality from breast cancer, however, is not lower in older women, leading us to explore issues associated with treatment choice and other patient- and tumor-related factors that might affect disease-specific survival.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SCREENING</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The majority of breast cancers in the United States are diagnosed as a result of an abnormal screening study, although a significant number are first brought to attention by the patient. Breast cancer screening in a postmenopausal woman includes mammography and a physical examination. After menopause, estrogen levels diminish, breast glandular tissue and ductal tissue decrease, fat tissue increases, and there are fewer cysts and fibroadenomas. These age-related changes in breast tissue, especially the increased percentage of fat tissue, allow for improved contrast between small foci of malignancy and the surrounding breast tissue, resulting in fewer false-negative mammographic examinations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Several randomized trials show that the routine use of screening mammography in women aged 50 through 75 improves survival by detecting breast carcinoma at an earlier stage and before metastatic dissemination.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Only limited data are available to provide guidance for screening in women older than 75 years. Guidelines differ among experts; we suggest consideration of annual or biennial screening in women age 75 and older if their estimated life expectancy is at least 10 years. For women in this age group with life expectancies between 5 and 10 years, screening is not likely to be of value in improving breast cancer–related mortality; however, shared decision-making should be used in discussing screening and decided upon on an individualized basis. Decision aids can be helpful when discussing the patient’s risk of developing breast cancer, the potential benefits and harms of screening, and the patient’s values. Physical examination by health</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">professionals remains an essential and complementary adjunct to mammographic screening and is especially important in women who decline or are not likely to benefit by mammographic screening. <span class="s1">Table 89-1 </span>presents our recommendations for the screening of older women.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 89-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>SCREENING GUIDELINES FOR BREAST CANCER IN WOMEN OLDER THAN 70 YEARS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PRESENTATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Breast cancer usually presents either as a breast mass or a suspicious finding on a mammogram. The discovery of a breast mass in a postmenopausal woman requires prompt attention, as the majority of palpable masses in this age group are malignant and all require biopsy. Mammography can help define the nature of a mass and detect other nonpalpable lesions if present and should be performed when a breast mass is found. A small percent (up to 15%) of palpable breast cancers in women may not show on mammogram (false negatives) but require biopsy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Locally advanced breast cancer can present with axillary adenopathy (suggesting locoregional disease) or skin findings such as erythema, thickening, or dimpling of the overlying skin (peau d’orange), suggesting inflammatory breast cancer. Symptoms of metastatic breast cancer can be nonspecific (eg, weight loss, fatigue, or loss of appetite) or can depend on the organs involved, with the most common sites of involvement being the bone (eg, back or leg pain), liver (abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice), and lungs (eg, shortness of breath or cough).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DIAGNOSIS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Typically, a stepwise process of diagnosis and definitive surgery is followed, as depicted in <span class="s1">Figure 89-3</span>. This allows for pathologic confirmation of cancer and time to decide surgical treatment choice.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIGURE 89-3. <span class="s5">Stepwise evaluation of suspicious breast finding.

If the core biopsy is negative or inconclusive, unless the mass proves to be a cyst and resolves after aspiration, further biopsy, preferably excision, is necessary. If atypical ductal hyperplasia is found on core biopsy, excisional biopsy is required, because a small proportion of suspicious lesions for which core biopsy finds only atypical hyperplasia may also contain in situ or invasive cancer when excised.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis of breast cancer is defined by the presence of malignant epithelial cells (carcinoma) on biopsy. When biopsy is diagnostic of malignancy, preoperative evaluation typically includes a complete history</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and physical examination, a complete blood count and chemistry profile, and a chest x-ray. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breasts may also be helpful in the management of older women in specific settings but is not recommended for routine screening or diagnostic purposes. However, bilateral mammography should be performed on all patients during their diagnostic work-up to evaluate both the ipsilateral breast and the contralateral breast for other nonpalpable lesions.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">POSTDIAGNOSIS EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once a patient is diagnosed with breast cancer, specific receptor testing is performed and appropriate staging work-up is necessary to determine local and distant extent of disease.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Breast Cancer Receptor Testing</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Newly diagnosed breast cancer must be tested for estrogen receptor (ER), PR, and overexpression of HER2 receptor status. This information is critical for both prognostic and therapeutic purpose because breast cancer is characterized into different subtypes by whether they express ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. The majority (80%) of cases are hormone receptor (ER and/or PR positive), followed by HER2 overexpression. ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative (triple-negative) cancers compromise approximately 10% of cases.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Staging</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guidelines set the standard for breast cancer staging. This system categorizes the extent of malignancy according to the size of the primary lesion (T), the extent of nodal involvement (N), and the occurrence of metastasis (M). Tumor size (the largest diameter of the infiltrating component) and the extent of nodal involvement (the number positive) are determined from pathologic examination and are included in the pathology report and ascertainment of staging. Nodal assessment is done either by sentinel lymph node biopsy or by axillary dissection. Sentinel lymph node mapping and sampling is preferred as it allows identification and assessment of the one to four nodes most likely to contain cancer. If an axillary lymph node dissection is completed, a sample of at least six nodes (if possible) is ideal in order to reflect the prognosis accurately.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Most patients presenting with breast cancer have stage I or II disease (confined to the breast) with no or limited (ie, less than three) nodes involved and do not routinely undergo additional work-up for metastatic disease in the absence of signs or symptoms suspicious for distant spread. Patients with stage III breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer and those with signs or symptoms worrisome for metastatic disease should have imaging with computerized tomography of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a radionuclide bone scan or a positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan to rule out metastases. The use of tumor markers (such as the carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and mucin antigens CA27.29 and CA15.3) and circulating tumor cells is not recommended as part of the staging evaluation.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TREATMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The vast majority of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in the United States have no evidence of metastatic disease. For these patients, the treatment approach depends on stage at presentation, prognostic receptor status, and, in some cases, biomarker testing. The general treatment principles of carcinoma in situ, early (nonmetastatic) breast cancer, and metastatic breast cancer will be reviewed here.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carcinoma In Situ</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast represents a heterogenous group of neoplastic lesions confined to the breast ducts. The goal of therapy for DCIS is to prevent the development of invasive cancer and therapeutic approaches include surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Mastectomy cures almost all patients, but breast-conserving procedures followed by breast irradiation are as effective for patients with smaller lesions. Axillary dissection or sentinel node biopsy finds metastases in less than 1% of patients and is generally not recommended. Excision alone, without local RT, may be appropriate for patients with lesions less than 2.5 cm with generous (&gt; 1 cm) margins of normal tissue surrounding the in-situ component. Most DCIS lesions are ER- and PR-positive and clinical trials on tamoxifen have been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence and contralateral breast cancer in women with DCIS but without improvements in survival. For older women with DCIS, the risks of tamoxifen are likely to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">exceed the benefits in many women and we recommend consideration of tamoxifen use on an individual basis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is more common in premenopausal patients, lacks clinical and mammographic signs, is bilateral in 25% to 35% of cases, and is usually an incidental finding at breast biopsy. It is not a palpable lesion. Treatment options range from observation to bilateral mastectomy, but observation is preferred. Of note, 20% to 40% of patients with LCIS subsequently develop infiltrating ductal cancer, with both the ipsilateral breast and the contralateral breast at similar risk. LCIS serves as a high-risk marker for subsequent invasive cancer, and treatment selection must rest on the desires of the patient. Most experts recommend close follow-up of these patients, without aggressive surgery. Tamoxifen dramatically decreases the risk of subsequent invasive breast cancer in patients with LCIS and should be considered on an individual basis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Early-Stage, Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, patients with early-stage breast cancer undergo primary surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) to the breast and regional nodes with or without RT. Following definitive local treatment, patients should be offered adjuvant systemic therapy based on primary tumor characteristics, such as tumor grade, size, lymph node involvement, and ER, PR, and HER2 receptor status. However, some patients with early-stage disease, particularly those with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer, may benefit from upfront (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy first, followed by surgery. Although the field is constantly changing, there are several key principles of surgical, radiation, and systemic treatment, which we will review here.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surgical Management</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Breast-conserving the rapy <span class="p">The breast-conserving approach to breast cancer management involves removing the tumor mass with a clear margin of surrounding normal breast tissue (lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, quadrantectomy, etc), assessing axillary lymph nodes when indicated, and for many, delivering local breast irradiation (discussed below) after surgery.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Breast-conserving therapy results in virtually identical relapse-free and overall survival compared with more extensive surgical treatment, including simple, modified-radical, and radical mastectomy. It allows patients to preserve their breast without sacrificing oncologic outcomes. Criteria that</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">preclude breast-conserving surgery include: two or more gross tumors in separate quadrants of the breast, large tumor/breast size ratio (mass &gt; 5 cm in size), which interferes with cosmesis, diffuse indeterminate or malignant- appearing microcalcifications, a history of therapeutic irradiation to the chest (eg, radiation for Hodgkin disease), and persistently positive margins despite attempts at re-excision. For patients who desire breast conservation therapy but are not candidates at the time of presentation, an alternative approach is the use of neoadjuvant therapy (discussed below), which may allow for desired surgical management without compromising survival outcomes.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mastectomy <span class="p">A mastectomy is indicated for patients who are not candidates for breast conserving therapy and those who prefer a mastectomy. Reasonably healthy older women tolerate simple or modified mastectomies as well as younger women do and should be offered the option when clinically appropriate.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Axillary assessment <span class="p">Tumor size and axillary nodal status are the most consistent predictors of the risk of recurrence and key in making decisions about the risk/benefit ratio of adjuvant systemic treatment. The evaluation of the regional nodes depends on whether axillary involvement is suspected prior to surgery. For patients with clinically suspicious axillary nodes, a preoperative work-up including biopsy to confirm nodal involvement is recommended to determine the best surgical approach (eg, upfront axillary node dissection at the time of breast surgery) and whether neoadjuvant therapy should be considered. For patients with a clinically negative axillary examination, sentinel lymph node mapping and sampling at the time of surgery is recommended. When one or two sentinel lymph node(s) are positive (pathologically involved), further axillary dissection can be omitted without any detrimental effects on local recurrence or survival. For patients with three or more sentinel nodes involved, axillary dissection is indicated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In older women, the role of assessing axillary nodes is quite controversial because of the risk of arm morbidity. If adjuvant chemotherapy is not a consideration because of physician or patient choice, the risk of axillary dissection is not worth its prognostic yield, regardless of the primary tumor size. It is generally acceptable to omit axillary assessment in older women (age 70 or older) with small (2 cm or less), clinically node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer, who will take adjuvant endocrine therapy for at least 5 years.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Breast reconstruction <span class="p">For older women who have had a mastectomy, breast reconstruction represents another option for restoring body image. Many physicians, because of personal bias, are unlikely to discuss reconstruction with older patients. However, this procedure can be done safely in older patients and should be discussed, with subsequent surgical consultation if desired.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjuvant Radiation</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radiation after mastectomy <span class="p">The likelihood of local recurrence is directly proportional to both the size of the primary lesion and the number of involved axillary nodes. Postoperative adjuvant irradiation is generally recommended for patients with primary lesions greater than 5 cm or with four or more positive nodes. It is also considered reasonable for any woman with breast cancer that involves lymph nodes to receive postmastectomy “adjuvant” irradiation therapy to the chest wall and the contiguous regional lymph nodes (internal mammary, supraclavicular, and upper axilla), because it reduces the likelihood of local recurrence (recurrence in the mastectomy site or contiguous nodal areas) by 70% and improves overall breast cancer– specific survival.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radiation after lumpectomy <span class="p">Breast irradiation after removal of tumor mass reduces the likelihood of recurrence in the affected breast from 30% to 40% to less than 10% and may improve survival in women with higher-risk breast cancers. Although radiation after breast conservation is standard therapy in younger women, older women with smaller, hormone receptor–positive breast cancers (≤ 3 cm in largest dimension) may be spared breast irradiation if they are willing to take adjuvant endocrine therapy. In such patients, survival is identical, although there is a somewhat higher risk of breast recurrence over a 10-year period (about 10% without radiation and 2%–3% with radiation). Most breast relapses occur in or in close proximity to the previously resected lesion. Other techniques, such as brachytherapy (localized RT), may prove to be as effective as whole-breast RT and can be completed over a period of days to weeks. For healthy older patients at high risk for in-breast recurrence (tumors 3 cm or greater or positive lymph nodes) and reasonable life expectancy, breast radiation is recommended.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjuvant Systemic Therapy</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Systemic therapy refers to the medical treatment of breast cancer using chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and/or biologic therapy. Tumor characteristics predict which patients are likely to benefit from specific types of systemic therapy in early-stage breast cancer. These therapies can be given preoperatively (neoadjuvant) or postoperatively (adjuvant). The goal of systemic therapy in early breast cancer is to reduce risk of and delay relapse as well as improve survival. Such treatment is aimed at eradicating occult, clinically undetectable metastasis. <span class="s1">Figure 89-4 </span>shows the cause of death for women with breast cancer by stage of disease and <span class="s1">Figure 89-5 </span>shows the overall survival of older women by breast cancer stage. As demonstrated in these figures, women, and in particular older women, mostly die of non–breast cancer causes in the setting of early-stage disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment considerations should therefore be individualized based on general prognostic tumor-related markers (biology and extent of disease), global health status (providing information on life expectancy and treatment tolerance), and patient preference, and not on chronological age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 89-4. </span>Cause of death after approximately 28-year follow-up for White women age greater than or equal to 70 with breast cancer.

Data suggest that standard combination regimens (two or more chemotherapy drugs) are efficacious in older patients, with acceptable toxicity. Indeed, studies have shown a survival benefit for women aged 50 to 70 with regimens that are also well tolerated in healthy women older than 70 years. However, prior to making decisions regarding chemotherapy, a risk-stratified approach should be done to take into account patient and tumor characteristics to select which older patients should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The decision to proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy is thus chosen on the basis of the risk to benefit ratio: the anticipated risk reduction for metastatic disease is weighed against the risk of toxicity from treatment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Tools to predict the benefit of chemotherapy are available. These include genomic expression profiles of the tumor (Oncotype Dx), which are used in routine practice to determine the specific benefit of chemotherapy in given subsets of patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. Online calculators, such as PREDICT, can also be used as a starting point to estimate overall survival benefits with and without chemotherapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Tools to predict the patient’s life expectancy (exclusive of their breast cancer diagnosis), general health status, and risk for chemotherapy toxicity should be used to assess the older patient. There is vast heterogeneity in function and comorbidity in older patients at any given age. <span class="s1">Table 89-2 </span>presents a list of key websites and resources for providers who care for older patients with cancer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 89-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>KEY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES FOR HELP IN CARING FOR OLDER PATIENTS WITH CANCER</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">An online tool, ePrognosis (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">https://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/</span>), estimates life expectancy based on medical history and has been validated for use among women with early-stage breast cancer. By providing an estimate of noncancer mortality risk, the ePrognosis tool can help frame treatment decisions for adjuvant chemotherapy and provide a starting point for conversation with the patient about their own preferences.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Additionally, we recommend that patients older than 70 years and/or with multiple comorbid conditions should be screened for geriatric syndromes using a brief geriatric screening tool, such as VES-13 or G8. Based on the results of the screening, a comprehensive geriatric assessment (GA)—which includes evaluations of functional status, comorbid medical conditions, cognitive status, psychological state, social support, nutritional status, and a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">review of the medication list—may help to uncover age-related deficits that are not routinely obtained in a history and physical examination. This cancer- specific, comprehensive GA, developed by Dr. Arti Hurria and colleagues, was shown to identify older adults who have diminished life expectancy and/or are at risk for hospitalization and functional decline. Findings from the GA may guide interventions that can improve the ability to undergo cancer treatment, with emerging evidence showing that these GA-driven interventions can reduce chemotherapy toxicity and improve the quality of life of older patients with cancer. Several national and international organizations now recommend incorporating data from a GA for optimizing treatment in older patients who are planned to receive systemic therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Recently, a new risk prediction model was developed predict chemotherapy-related toxicities in patients older than 65 years with early- stage breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The Cancer and Aging Research Group–Breast Cancer (CARG-BC) risk score is derived by combining eight disease and patient-reported predictors, including: use of an anthracycline chemotherapy, stage II or III breast cancer, planned treatment duration, abnormal liver function, low hemoglobin, falls, limited walking ability, and lack of social support (<span class="s1">Table 89-3</span>). The total score classifies patients age 65 and older with early breast cancer into low, intermediate, or high risk for severe, debilitating, or deadly side effects to chemotherapy. The CARG-BC score was also validated and outperformed other tools, including a general risk prediction model for older adults with cancer (nonbreast cancer–specific) and physician-rated performance status (ie, “eyeball test”).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 89-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>CANCER AND AGING RESEARCH GROUP- BREAST CANCER (CARG-BC) SCORE CALCULATOR</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Endocrine the rapy <span class="p">Almost all patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-related mortality, regardless of age. Although older adults may have more comorbidities that predispose them to increased toxicities related to endocrine treatment, the benefits of adjuvant endocrine therapy on reducing the risks of recurrence and death from breast cancer are similar to younger patients. We recommend that</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">patients at risk for treatment-related toxicities due to adjuvant endocrine therapy should be managed appropriately, with care coordinated between their oncology team and primary care clinician or geriatrician. Patients at increased risk of major toxicities, such as those with preexisting history of thrombosis, cerebrovascular disease, osteoporosis, or fractures should have shared discussions with their medical team to make the most informed decisions.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Endocrine the rapy as initial (or primary) treatme nt <span class="p">Although surgical resection reduces the risk of local recurrence and its associated morbidity, for many older patients, especially those with advanced but localized lesions (T3 and T4) and those with significant comorbidity or frailty (where anesthesia is contraindicated), initial treatment with endocrine therapy is appropriate in patients with hormone receptor–positive tumors. Tumor shrinkage occurs in 40% to 70% of patients and tumor control usually is maintained for 18 to 24 months. The majority of patients treated initially with endocrine therapy do not achieve complete tumor regression and will need surgery or other treatments to control the primary lesion if their life expectancy is longer than several years. Although surgery is more likely to be effective (and potentially curative) in patients with small lesions, several randomized trials comparing surgery with endocrine treatment for initial therapy suggest that long-term survival is not changed by using endocrine therapy as the initial treatment and reserving surgical management for patients with tumor progression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radiation therapy also can be used as “salvage” treatment after endocrine therapy fails, but large tumor masses, especially those greater than 3 cm and those with extensive skin involvement, frequently respond only partially. For patients treated with endocrine therapy because comorbidity precludes surgical therapy, radiation therapy should be considered when tumor shrinkage is maximal to try to prolong the duration of local tumor control. In the authors’ opinion, older women with localized breast cancer amenable to surgery should be offered surgical treatment at diagnosis unless they are extremely frail or have dramatically reduced life expectancy.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Metastatic Breast Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management of metastatic breast cancer in older women follows the same principles as in younger women, with few exceptions. Like younger women, older patients with metastatic breast cancer are currently incurable and have a median survival of approximately 2 to 7 years after the discovery of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">recurrence with about 20% of those with hormone receptor positive tumors surviving 5 years. The goal of therapy is palliation rather than cure and patients may derive considerable palliative benefit from judiciously chosen therapy. Bone, soft tissue (skin and lymph nodes), pleural, and pulmonary metastases are the most common sites of breast cancer recurrence. Women with localized, symptomatic lesions in brain, skin, lymph nodes, and bone should also be considered for palliative radiation therapy, which relieves symptoms in the majority of patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with disseminated metastases should be considered for palliative systemic treatment and consideration for clinical trial enrollment should occur at every line of therapy. <span class="s1">Table 89-4 </span>describes endocrine and cytotoxic agents used in the treatment of breast cancer and their common and major side effects. Endocrine therapy usually is associated with minimal toxicity, while the toxicity associated with chemotherapy is frequently substantial and, in a small percent of patients, may be life-threatening.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provided that metastases are not rapidly progressive or life-threatening, all women with hormone receptor–positive, metastatic breast cancer should have an initial trial of endocrine therapy. The combination of a cyclin- dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor and an aromatase inhibitor appears to be effective and of comparable tolerability in older patients as in younger patients; however, older adults should be carefully monitored for myelosuppression or diarrhea, depending on the choice of CDK4/6 inhibitor used.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 89-4 <span class="s3">■ </span>ENDOCRINE AND CYTOTOXIC AGENTS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Once breast cancer is deemed refractory to endocrine therapy or in the setting of triple negative disease (breast cancers without estrogen, progesterone expression, and HER2 overexpression), chemotherapy is usually the treatment of choice. Chemotherapy may also be a first-line therapy if life-threatening or rapidly progressive (visceral) disease is present. Chemotherapy should not be withheld solely on the basis of older age and decisions on the administration of chemotherapy in older women</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should be individualized based on the extent of their tumor, symptoms, and the potential benefits and risks of treatment. Sequential single-agent therapy as opposed to combination chemotherapy as in most patients, regardless of age, is equally effective and less toxic. Osteoclast inhibition with bisphosphonates or denosumab significantly reduces the risk of skeletal- related events in women with bone metastases.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older patients with metastatic disease, whose general health is otherwise satisfactory, display response and toxicity profiles to chemotherapy similar to those of their younger counterparts. Most cytotoxic drugs are metabolized in the liver with only a select few dependent on renal excretion (methotrexate, carboplatin, and cisplatin); major liver dysfunction probably is required to alter drug metabolism significantly. Chemotherapy-related myelosuppression is more common in older patients due to diminished bone marrow reserve with aging; nausea and vomiting are seen less frequently than they are in younger patients. Of importance, psychosocial adjustments to chemotherapy appear to be better for older than for younger patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Complete and partial responses to most single chemotherapy agents range from 20% to 30%, while responses to combination chemotherapy average 50% to 70%. Responses generally last an average of 6 to 12 months; response rates to subsequent “salvage” regimens are generally low and last only several months.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SPECIAL ISSUES AND SPOPULATIONS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prevention</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is no simple strategy to prevent breast cancer in older women. As the pathogenesis of breast cancer is likely to be related to interactions of estrogens, other hormones, and breast tissue, agents that lower breast tissue estrogen exposure, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors, have been studied and found to be effective in breast cancer prevention lowering the incidence by about half. None of these large trials, even after long term follow have shown any survival advantage in spite of decreased breast cancer occurrences in the treated patients. At present, we believe that only a few older high-risk patients should be considered for preventive therapy and that these patients should have an estimated life expectancy of at least 10 years. Like younger patients, older patients should be encouraged to maintain an ideal body mass and engage in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">exercise. In addition, prophylactic, contralateral surgery as a method for prevention is not recommended. In older women with <i>BRCA1 </i>or <i>BRCA2 </i>mutations prophylactic surgery should be considered on a case by case basis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Follow-Up for Women With Early Breast Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is good evidence that close follow-up after diagnosis or adjuvant therapy does not result in improved overall survival, but that detection of early skin or lymph node (soft tissue) recurrence may result in more effective palliation. Mammography is an exception, and in women with life expectancies of at least 5 to 10 years, should be performed yearly or every other year to detect new primary lesions. Because a history of breast cancer is a risk factor for another breast cancer, follow-up visits do provide an opportunity for patients to express concerns and for physicians to give them reassurance. Extensive laboratory and radiologic procedures are now available for the detection of metastatic disease, but trials have indicated that a brief, focused history and a limited physical examination (skin, chest, breast, and abdominal examination) detect more than 75% of metastases.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even when mammography is not recommended, an annual breast exam should be part of the patient’s care. National guidelines suggest that optimal follow- up consists of periodic clinic visits and annual screening mammography in asymptomatic patients with a history of breast cancer. Available data do not support the use of routine laboratory work, imaging, or tumor markers for routine follow-up and should not be used in asymptomatic patients (<span class="s1">Table</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">89-5<span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 89-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>FOLLOW-UP OF EARLY BREAST CANCER AFTER DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL TREATMENT</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Male Breast Cancer</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of all breast cancer incidence and has a similar natural history as female breast cancer. Males usually present at a later stage, probably because of a delay in diagnosis. Almost all cases are sporadic, except for males with Klinefelter syndrome (sex chromosomes XXY)—in which the prevalence of breast cancer ranges from 3% to 6%—or men with the <i>BRCA2 </i>gene, which is associated with a 5% to 10% risk. Men with a <i>BRCA2 </i>are also at higher risk for prostate and other cancers. A careful family history is mandatory in all males with breast cancer. Mastectomy with axillary dissection is the standard approach to treatment but breast-conserving surgery and irradiation are appropriate for males with small tumors. Histologically, most lesions are infiltrating ductal carcinomas, and the frequency of ER-positive lesions is 70% to 80%.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because of the rarity of male breast cancer, there are few data on the role of adjuvant systemic therapy, and it is unlikely that large randomized trials will be undertaken. We suggest using the same guidelines for adjuvant therapy in men that are used in women with a similar stage and receptor status.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uncontrolled trials suggest that such treatment is similar in efficacy in men to that in women, although tamoxifen is the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy in men.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Men with metastatic breast cancer are incurable but frequently respond to endocrine therapy, including tamoxifen and androgen deprivation with LHRH agonists and aromatase inhibitors if they are hormone receptor positive. The results with systemic chemotherapy are similar to those in females.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative Care, End-of-Life Care, and Hospice</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For many patients and families with cancer, palliative care is synonymous with end-of-life care. This certainly is not the case and especially in the care of older patients with symptoms, early palliative care at the time of diagnosis of metastases or even for some patients with potentially curable disease, palliative care can make the cancer journey much more tolerable for both the patient and their family. Studies have shown that integrating palliative care with standard cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, can lead to significant improvements in quality of life and even survival. Although many oncologists are capable of managing the complex array of symptoms related to cancer and its treatment, partnering with a trained team of palliative care experts results in better outcomes and relieves the oncologist from providing the extensive array of supportive services needed for their patients. We</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">suggest that a palliative care consultation be considered for all older patients with metastatic breast cancer and symptomatic patients with early breast cancer early in their course and preferably at the time of diagnosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For those with metastasis, the vast majority of older patients will succumb to their breast cancer. Those receiving palliative care can be easily transitioned to end-of-life care and hospice care. For those who have not had palliative care interventions, end-of-life care provided by palliative care experts and transition to hospice is recommended.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disparities</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Racial and age disparities in breast cancer care and outcomes have been well documented and have persisted over time, despite increasing awareness of this issue. Past examinations of receipt of care and outcomes for women have consistently demonstrated lower rates of treatment and worse outcomes for Black and older patients compared to their White and younger counterparts. Furthermore, studies within cohorts of older patients also demonstrate racial disparities, including more delays to treatment, less standard therapy, shorter durations in therapy, and higher mortality rates for older Black versus White women. Patients with less access to care, those who are underinsured, and those from lower socioeconomic groups also suffer from worse outcomes from breast cancer. Assurance that all patients receive guideline-concordant care is a national priority and rigorous interventions to better understand optimal ways of delivering care to all women are desperately needed. Patients felt to be at risk for problems with system navigation and social issues should be referred for patient navigation, social work, and resource assistance whenever possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CONCLUSION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Breast cancer is a major gerontologic problem. Both physician and patient education concerning screening, early diagnosis, and management of breast cancer in this age group are required. Available data indicate that optimal treatment of breast cancer in older women results in outcomes similar to those from treatment of younger women. The GA should be used to optimize treatment decisions and those older patients with satisfactory function and good life expectancy should be managed with judicious “state-of-the-art” therapy. Palliative care should be initiated early in almost all symptomatic patients. Barriers to the treatment of breast cancer in older women are</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">generic to the treatment of all illnesses in this age group and include access to care, transportation, adequate family and social support, physician bias, racial inequities, and treatment costs. Changes in health care policy, as well as focused research related to cancer in the geriatric population, will be needed to overcome these obstacles.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Amin MB, Edge S, Greene F, et al (eds). <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (8th edition)</i>.

Currently about 248,000 US men per year are diagnosed with prostate cancer and about 34,000 US men per year die of the disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The only undisputed risk factors for prostate cancer are older age, African-American race, and positive family history. Prostate cancer is generally a disease of older men; risk increases exponentially with age, with a median age at presentation of 66 years. More than half of prostate cancer diagnoses and 90% of prostate cancer deaths occur in men older than 65. The incidence rates of the disease among African-American men are higher than rates for men in <i>any </i>other racial or ethnic background. African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and to die from it than their White counterparts. The estimated lifetime risk of prostate cancer is 17.6% for White and 20.6% for African-Americans, while the estimated lifetime risk of death is 2.8% and 4.7%. Early-onset prostate cancer may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Approximately 10% of all prostate cancer cases are hereditary, with an onset 6 to 7 years earlier than nonhereditary cases. Several germline mutations such as <i>BRCA1/2, HOXB13</i>, or <i>ATM </i>may also identify families at high risk. <i>BRCA1/2 </i>germline mutations are present in up to 6% of unselected prostate cancer patients. The prospective Identification of Men With a Genetic Predisposition to Prostate Cancer targeted screening study confirmed a higher incidence of prostate cancer, at a younger age and with more clinically significant tumors, only in <i>BRCA2 </i>mutation carriers compared with noncarriers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Additional factors such as diet, obesity, hormones, inflammation and sexually transmitted diseases, and occupational exposure have all been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis, but without consistent results. Dietary fat may be a risk factor for prostate cancer. Multiple epidemiologic, case- control, and cohort studies have suggested a moderate-to-strong increased risk of developing prostate cancer, particularly advanced disease, associated with total dietary fat, saturated fat, α-linolenic fatty acid, and cooked red meat. Two large prospective studies and a smaller case-control study suggest that fish intake may be protective, possibly owing to marine omega-3 fatty acids—known antagonists of arachidonic acid, which suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Evidence for the association with dietary fat is further correlated with worldwide incidence patterns; prostate cancer is more common in the United States and northern European countries and is relatively rare in Asia and Africa. When Asian men migrate to the West and change from a low-fat to a high-fat diet, their risk of prostate cancer increases. However, many of the men migrating from low-fat diet areas also consume green tea and soy products, which contain isoflavones and estrogen that may act as antioxidants and chemoprotectants against prostate-specific carcinogenesis. There appears to be an inverse relationship between soy intake and prostate cancer risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><ul id="l3"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">List the risk factors for the development of prostate cancer.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Understand the screening recommendations for prostate cancer in older men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="1."><h3 style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">There is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment shown to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer.</h3></li><li data-list-text="2."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Life expectancy and comorbidities should be considered before initiating prostate cancer screening.</h3></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Describe the treatment options for localized and advanced prostate cancer in older patients.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><h3 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Localized prostate cancer in an older patient can be effectively</h3><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">3. <span class="h3">treated with a range of therapies including watchful waiting, active surveillance, surgery, and/or radiation.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is no consistent association between obesity and prostate cancer incidence. However, there are associations between obesity and aggressive prostate cancer, recurrence after primary therapy, and death from prostate cancer. Data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) suggest that obesity increases the risk of higher-grade cancers, but decreases the risk of low-grade prostate cancer. These findings suggest that obesity may somehow play a role in the progression from latent to clinically significant prostate cancer. Data from a prospective study of 3398 African-American and 22,673 non-Hispanic White men who participated in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) demonstrated that obesity was more strongly associated with increased prostate cancer risk among African- American than non-Hispanic White men and that reducing obesity among African-American men could reduce the racial disparity in cancer incidence. Although the specific role of obesity in prostate cancer risk is unclear, it may be linked to other risk factors such as dietary fat and meat intake, hormone metabolism, and insulin metabolism. The prevalence of obesity also correlates with prostate cancer risk across populations and may provide a link between the increased risk of prostate cancer with westernization.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk for several cancers, but their effect on prostate cancer risk is unclear. There is an inverse association with use of tomatoes and tomato products, presumably owing to the effects of lycopene, the most common carotenoid in the human body and one of the most potent carotenoid antioxidants. The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) found that frequent consumption of tomato products is associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer, and in a meta-analysis of 21 case-control and cohort studies, a significant 10% to 20% risk reduction was associated with high versus low intake of tomatoes. The majority of these studies also show a stronger effect for cooked versus raw tomatoes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although it seems intuitive that testosterone levels may influence the incidence of prostate cancer, no evidence confirms this association.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dihydrotestosterone, the active hormone produced from the conversion of testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase, is associated in some studies with increased risk. A prospective, population-based study of 1156 men showed no correlation between 17 different hormones and prostate cancer development, with the possible exception of androstanediol glucuronide.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Importantly, no dose-response relationships were seen, suggesting that serum hormone levels may not be useful even in risk stratification.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is some evidence that chronic inflammation may increase prostate cancer risk. One meta-analysis of 11 studies on prostatitis and prostate cancer showed an overall relative risk of 1.6. A prospective study of men without biopsy indication (PCPT participants who had a negative end-of- study biopsy and who subsequently enrolled in the SELECT) demonstrated that benign tissue inflammation was positively associated with prostate cancer. Population studies have suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer in patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including syphilis, recurrent gonorrhea, human papilloma virus (HPV), and HIV. A meta-analysis of 17 studies of prostate cancer and sexual patterns suggested that an increased number of sexual partners is associated with an increased prostate cancer risk, possibly through an increased exposure to STDs. There are currently no strong data to suggest a link between benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) and prostate cancer risk.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PREVENTION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemoprevention is an area of ongoing research, and in many ways, prostate cancer is an ideal disease for this approach—relatively slow growing, centered in the older adult population, yet with devastating effects and difficult management after the onset of metastasis. To date, many promising agents have failed to show a protective benefit against developing prostate cancer, and no drugs or food supplements have been approved for prostate cancer prevention.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5α-Reductase Inhibitors</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finasteride blocks the actions of 5α-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. The PCPT and the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trials investigated the role of 5α-reductase in prostate cancer prevention. These trials were based on two observations: androgens are required for prostate cancer development</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and men with congenital 5α-reductase deficiency develop neither BPH nor prostate cancer. Both of these randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials showed prostate cancer risk reduction with finasteride. However, both trials also found an apparent increase in high-risk cancers in the intervention groups. High-grade prostate cancers are associated with a poorer prognosis after definitive therapy. Both the PCPT and REDUCE trials led the FDA to issue a safety announcement that 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of more serious prostate cancers and so are not approved for chemoprevention.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vitamin E and Selenium</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oxidative stress may play a role in the development of prostate cancer. Reactive oxygen species can damage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), lipids, and proteins. The association of prostate cancer and a high-fat diet may be secondary to the generation of increased fatty acids, which can cause lipid peroxidation. Selenium is an essential trace nutrient with antioxidant properties. α-Tocopherol is the most active and abundant source of vitamin E, and its antioxidant properties have been studied extensively in a variety of prostate cell lines and animal models. One trial of male smokers with a primary lung cancer end point included α-tocopherol (50 mg daily). Because groups taking α-tocopherol may have had decreased prostate cancer incidence and mortality, the role of antioxidants in prostate cancer prevention was studied further.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">SELECT was a large, randomized, prospective, double-blind trial designed to determine whether selenium and vitamin E decrease the risk of prostate cancer in healthy men. In 2008, the trial was stopped early when an interim analysis demonstrated no evidence of clinical benefit of either agent. In addition to the lack of benefit of either agent alone or combined, there was a nonsignificant increased risk of prostate cancer in the vitamin E alone group. With additional follow-up in 2011, the number of prostate cancers in patients treated with vitamin E alone was significantly increased compared to the placebo arm. Thus, although there was great excitement about antioxidant supplementation for prostate cancer prevention, particularly in older people, randomized prospective trial data has shown no overall benefit.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PRESENTATION/SCREENING</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most men who present with prostate cancer are asymptomatic, particularly in the era of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, which detects many cancers long before they are clinically apparent. Patients rarely have urinary symptoms, as the majority of cancers arise in the posterior aspect of the prostate. Most men undergo evaluation after routine screening reveals either an elevated PSA or abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE). Since the advent of PSA testing and regular screening, in the United States the majority of patients have clinically localized, intermediate-risk prostate cancer at diagnosis. A minority of patients are diagnosed when they present with symptomatic metastatic disease, usually manifested as bony pain. For example, in 1988, 14% of new prostate cancer patients presented with metastatic disease, but that number had fallen to 3.3% by 1998 and has remained stable since that time. Although screening has strongly influenced this downward stage migration, there is still a debate as to whether it has significantly decreased prostate cancer–specific mortality.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Two large-scale, long-term, randomized clinical trials were designed to evaluate whether screening decreases mortality. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) trial was based in the United States and randomized over 76,000 men (age 55–74) to either an annual screening arm or control group. Those patients randomized to get screened had an annual PSA value for 6 years as well as a DRE for 4 years. After 7 years, screening was associated with a 22% relative increase in prostate cancers diagnosed with no difference in prostate cancer–specific mortality after both 7 and 10 years. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial randomized over 180,000 men (age 50–74) to screening versus control. In contrast to the PLCO trial, PSA screening resulted in a significant 20% relative reduction in prostate cancer–specific mortality after a median follow-up of 13 years (the number of men needed to be invited for screening to prevent one prostate cancer death was 742). The updated findings from the follow-up of the ERSPC trial (maximum of 16 years) corroborate earlier results that PSA screening significantly reduces prostate cancer–specific mortality. However, it also reconfirms that PSA screening does not reduce all-cause mortality.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The results of the Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) in men aged 50 to 69 suggested that a single PSA test did not improve prostate cancer–specific mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years. However, the optimal time intervals for PSA testing and when to stop</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">screening is still unknown and under debate. One study predicted a 27% relative decrease in the probability of lives saved if the stopping age for PSA screening was changed from 74 to 69. This was tempered with a 50% relative decrease in overdiagnosis. A comparison of systematic and opportunistic screening suggested a reduction in overdiagnosis and cancer- specific mortality by systematic screening, while opportunistic screening resulted in a higher overdiagnosis rate with a marginal survival benefit. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggested that PSA screening after age 75 should be done only in very healthy men with little or no comorbidity to detect the small number of aggressive cancers that pose a significant risk if left undetected.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A summary of the various screening recommendations is provided in <span class="s1">Table 90-1</span>. These recommendations do not apply for men at higher risk for prostate cancer. In the absence of unified guidelines, a difficult task for primary care physicians is thus deciding which patients should undergo screening for prostate cancer. In the absence of definitive data, a reasonable approach to screening should involve an active discussion between the physician and patient, taking into consideration the patient’s overall health and treatment preferences. Men with a life expectancy of less than 10 to 15 years (owing to age or comorbidities) should be informed that screening may not be beneficial. Younger men with a family history of prostate cancer or <i>BRCA2 </i>mutation and African-American men should be encouraged to undergo screening, as the disease prevalence is high in these groups. Any patient with symptoms that may be attributable to prostate cancer (bone pain, hypercalcemia, symptomatic pelvic lymphadenopathy) warrants a PSA evaluation as a part of his initial evaluation, since symptomatic patients can enjoy significant improvement with the institution of hormonal therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:47.2pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">TABLE 90-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>PSA SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS<span class="s21">A</span></p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the decision to do screening for prostate cancer is made, the appropriate examinations include a serum PSA and DRE. PSA is a protein produced and secreted by both normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. It provides a sensitive but not highly specific screening test, as it is also elevated with BPH, inflammation, and infection of the prostate. The usual cutoff is 4 ng/mL, but 15% of men with normal PSA levels will have prostate cancer and 2% will have high-grade prostate cancer. PSA is, however, more sensitive than DRE, detecting more cancers at earlier stage and smaller-sized cancers than rectal examination alone. The free-to-total PSA ratio stratifies the risk of prostate cancer in men with 4 to 10 ng/mL total PSA. PSA- doubling time is also a factor in prostate assessment, and any patient with a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rapid PSA-doubling time should be sent for further evaluation, even if the absolute value of the PSA is below the normal cutoff level. On the basis of an elevated PSA or an abnormal DRE, the patient should be referred for a transrectal or transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. In general, six to 12 cores are taken for evaluation; areas that are abnormal on DRE may receive more biopsy attempts. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a major tool for biopsy optimization with pooled sensitivity of greater than 0.90 and specificity of greater than 0.35. When mpMRI has shown a suspicious lesion, MR-targeted biopsy can be obtained through cognitive guidance, ultrasound/magnetic resonance fusion software, or direct in-bore guidance. In biopsy-naïve patients, the addition of targeted biopsy increases the number of detected prostate cancers by 20% to 30%.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">If the biopsy is positive, a Gleason score is assigned. This score is one of the most important determinants of prognosis. The pathologist assigns a numerical value (on a scale of 1–5) to the most prevalent and the second most prevalent grades of cancer seen in the specimens. The score is then reported on a scale of 2 to 10, with 10 being the most aggressive cancer.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gleason scores should be reported separately, for example, 3 + 4 = 7, as the primary pathology has prognostic implications. Risk stratification plays an important role in both the selection and timing of treatment and is an important part of the initial evaluation. After diagnosis, the natural course of prostate cancer can be estimated from tumor volume, aggressiveness, PSA level, and extent of disease. Tumor volume assessment includes local stage, the number of positive biopsy cores, and the extent of cancer in affected cores. Gleason score is currently the standard measurement of aggressiveness with grade group 1 tumors being Gleason score ≤ 6, grade group 2 being Gleason score 3 + 4, grade group 3 being Gleason score 4 + 3, grade group 4 being Gleason score 8, and grade group 5 being Gleason score 9 to 10. Taking all of these prognostic factors into account, newly diagnosed patients are classified as having very low-, low-, intermediate-, or high-risk disease. The patients in the intermediate risk group can be further stratified to favorable and unfavorable subgroups. A summary of the risk stratification and recommendations on staging is provided in <span class="s1">Table 90-2</span>. In addition to these broad risk groups, multiple nomograms are available to help clinicians estimate an individual patient’s probability of localized disease, risk of progression without intervention, and risk of recurrence after definitive therapy. Several of these tools are available online, and they can sometimes</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be more helpful than the broad categories in assessing an individual’s risk, as they allow integration of discordant factors (eg, high PSA with low Gleason score). PSA velocity prior to diagnosis may also provide valuable information in risk assessment; a PSA velocity greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL in the year prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) is predictive of greater risk of biochemical recurrence, cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 90-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>GUIDELINES FOR STAGING IMAGING EVALUATION</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The conventional staging evaluation for men with known prostate cancer or symptoms that could be attributable to metastatic prostate cancer includes serum chemistries, PSA, bone scan, and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis. These initial tests provide evaluation of the most likely sites of metastatic disease to avoid inappropriate surgical intervention or radiation therapy. As described in <span class="s1">Table 90-2</span>, the extent of evaluation for metastatic disease relates to the likelihood of finding disease. However, advanced imaging technologies have been dramatically changing this field.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For example, choline positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, prostate- specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT, and whole-body MRI provide more sensitive detection of lymph nodes and bone metastases than the conventional tools. <span class="s1">Figure 90-1 </span>illustrates a stepwise approach to evaluation, monitoring, and treatment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 90-1. <span class="s5">Prostate cancer evaluation and management flowchart.

It was first proposed in the 1970s when research suggested that delaying therapy until the onset of symptoms did not increase prostate cancer–specific mortality in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. However, a subsequent study found that overall survival was longer in patients treated immediately, and the rate of complications, such as bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and ureteral obstruction was higher in the deferred group.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because PSA testing allows detection of cancers some 5 to 15 years earlier than DRE, men with T1c (PSA detected) tumors treated with watchful waiting may have better than 20-year disease-specific survival. Among a prospective cohort of 300 men (mean age 72) with localized disease, an equivalent 15-year overall survival was observed in those who deferred therapy versus those who received initial treatment. Watchful waiting, either at the time of initial diagnosis or at the time of progression, may be applicable in older men without metastatic disease. In the AUA guideline, watchful waiting is recommended for men with a life expectancy greater than or equal to 5 years with low- or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. In patients with high-risk disease, watchful waiting should only be considered in asymptomatic men with limited life expectancy (≤ 5 years).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Active Surveillance</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Active surveillance or expectant management differs from watchful waiting in the intensity of monitoring and the expectation of delayed but successful definitive, potentially curative therapy. This strategy is based on the observation that there is tremendous heterogeneity in the natural history of prostate cancer, and a significant number of men may be “overdiagnosed” in the sense that diagnosis and treatment may not improve either QoL or survival. The selection criteria for active surveillance remain controversial, so should be made by the patient with his urologist. Active surveillance involves regular monitoring with PSA every 3 months, clinical examination with DRE every 6 months, and repeat biopsies as warranted by PSA and DRE (which can occur as frequently as once a year). An increase in PSA velocity (doubling time fewer than 3 years), primary Gleason pattern of 4 or 5 on repeat biopsy, or an increased number or extent of positive biopsy cores suggests progression of disease, and intervention with appropriately selected therapy should be initiated. Many experts feel that this is a reasonable approach for men with low-risk disease and may represent a practical compromise between radical treatment for all patients and watchful waiting with palliative treatment only (a strategy that undertreats aggressive disease). Although active surveillance may avoid overtreatment and allow patients to maintain their baseline QoL, the strategy carries with it a risk of local or metastatic progression before active treatment is initiated. It is important, therefore, that patients are made aware that even the most careful monitoring may miss the window for administering curative therapy.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Local Therapy: Surgery, Radiation, or Brachytherapy</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radical prostatectomy <span class="p">RP involves removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles, and is an appropriate therapy for any patient with disease confined to the prostate, a life expectancy more than 10 years, and no contraindications to surgery. Data have shown that outcomes are generally better with high- volume surgeons within high-volume medical centers. Laparoscopic and robotic prostatectomies have been refined and moved into mainstream care. Outcome data to date suggest that in the hands of an experienced surgeon, these approaches are comparable to open surgery and may involve less morbidity. Randomized clinical trials have shown no benefit for neoadjuvant hormonal therapy with RP. Pathologic examination after surgery allows for verification of organ confinement and margin status as well as complete histologic examination. Almost 50% of patients with biopsy Gleason 6 disease are upgraded to Gleason 7 or higher once the entire gland is removed and evaluated.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">External beam radiation the rapy <span class="p">External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in most centers is now delivered using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). IMRT is a form of external beam photon therapy that uses multiple radiation beam and/or arcs to provide a highly conformal treatment of the prostate with normal tissue sparing of adjacent organs. SBRT generally utilizes photon-based IMRT treatment to deliver hypofractionated radiation treatment usually in five or fewer fractions of treatment. Often gold fiducial markers are implanted in the prostate prior to EBRT to provide landmarks for accurate daily dosing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Radiation dosing is currently based on risk of recurrence. Patients with low-risk prostate cancer are generally treated with 70 to 75 Gy in 35 to 41 fractions. Higher doses of 75 to 80 Gy are recommended for patients with intermediate- and high-risk features. In addition, intermediate-risk patients benefit from 4 to 6 months of neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), while high-risk patients should receive neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT for a total of 2 to 3 years. Because the prostate is not removed with EBRT, there is no pathologic confirmation of the extent of disease or adjustment of the biopsy Gleason score. Relative contraindications to EBRT include active collagen vascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and microvascular damage from hypertension or diabetes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Brachythe rapy </span>Brachytherapy involves radioactive iodine (<span class="s22">125</span>I) or palladium (<span class="s22">103</span>Pd) implants, which are placed in the prostate under general anesthesia. They emit short-range radiation within the prostate, generally avoiding the bladder and rectum, and lose their radioactivity gradually. Prostate</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">brachytherapy as monotherapy is indicated for patients with low-risk disease and small prostate volume (&lt; 60 g). For intermediate-risk patients, brachytherapy is frequently combined with EBRT (40–50 Gy). High-risk patients are generally considered poor candidates for this treatment modality.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although there are no good randomized data comparing local treatment modalities, a review of 2991 patients treated at the Cleveland Clinic and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center showed similar 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival rates for RP, EBRT, and brachytherapy, leading the authors to conclude that intrinsic tumor characteristics rather than treatment modality play the larger role in determining progression after definitive therapy. Given similar outcomes between EBRT and prostatectomy, logistics and potential side effects may play a significant role in treatment decisions.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some men may not be candidates for major pelvic surgery, and therefore prostatectomy may not be an option. Others may find the 8 to 9 weeks of daily radiation treatments unacceptable and opt for prostatectomy or brachytherapy, which is completed in a single surgical procedure.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Incontinence is the primary side effect noted after prostatectomy, though reported rates vary significantly from surgeon to surgeon. EBRT causes short-term irritative bladder symptoms; long-term incontinence is rare.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bowel dysfunction is a potential short and/or delayed side effect of radiation therapy. Impotence occurs in as many as 50% of patients treated with any of the three local approaches, though it tends to occur later with EBRT than with prostatectomy. Primary care providers may want to refer patients to both urology and radiation oncology in order to fully educate patients about their choices.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primary Androgen Deprivation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with unfavorable prognostic factors, or those patients who are not interested in the risk-benefit ratio of local therapy, may choose primary hormonal therapy. Approximately 12.5% of the 3486 men in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study chose hormonal treatment as initial therapy, considered to be a surprisingly high number. Clearly, there is no chance of cure with this modality, but for some patients the risk of relapse may be too</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">high to pursue aggressive local therapy. There is also scant evidence about the outcomes associated with this approach. In the European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline, ADT monotherapy is not recommended for asymptomatic patients. In patients with locally advanced disease, ADT monotherapy is only recommended for those patients unwilling or unable to receive any form of local treatment if they have a PSA-doubling time of less than 12 months and a PSA value of greater than 50 ng/mL, a poorly differentiated tumor, or troublesome local disease-related symptoms.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjuvant Therapy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At this time, there is no standard adjuvant chemotherapy for patients at high- risk of recurrence, although there are several intergroup trials examining the role of adjuvant chemotherapy with both RP and EBRT. Adjuvant hormonal therapy, as noted earlier, is now standard of care with EBRT in patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease; after RP, it is recommended only for patients with node-positive disease. Patients whose PSA levels do not fall to an undetectable level after surgery should be evaluated for adjuvant salvage therapy, including EBRT with or without ADT, or ADT alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">POSTTREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The scheduled follow-up after definitive local therapy depends on the risk of recurrence and the potential for curative salvage therapy. Patients at high risk of recurrence who would be good candidates for further intervention should have regular PSA testing (every 1–3 months) and DRE at least annually.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients at low risk of recurrence or poor intervention candidates are more appropriately followed with evaluations every 4 to 6 months for the first 5 years and annually thereafter. Forty-five percent of patients who recur after prostatectomy do so within 2 years. Seventy-seven percent of recurrences occur within the first 5 years after prostatectomy and 96% within 9 years. Any patient with symptoms referable to local or systemic relapse (particularly new bone pain) should be evaluated with repeat serum and radiologic tests.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Biochemical Recurrence</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Biochemical recurrence after RP is defined as a PSA level greater than or equal to 0.2 ng/mL and rising on two or more determinations. Recurrence after EBRT has been redefined by consensus as nadir PSA plus 2. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pattern of local recurrence is usually 1 to 3 years after primary therapy, with a slowly rising PSA or new finding on DRE; these patients should be followed closely and referred for local salvage therapy, if appropriate. The need for biopsy of radiologically proven disease in this setting is controversial. Patients who relapse quickly after local therapy (&lt; 6 months) are more likely to have metastatic disease that was not discovered prior to definitive local therapy and are therefore unlikely to respond to local salvage therapy. As mentioned above, new PET imaging tracers appear more accurate in the assessment of prostate cancer. In 2019, the EAU guidelines for imaging in patients with recurrence recommend performing a PSMA PET/CT early after initial treatment if the result will influence subsequent treatment decisions.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with a rising PSA and no clinical, symptomatic, or radiographic evidence of disease present a therapeutic dilemma, as there is no clear consensus as to the timing of further therapy. Some men with biochemical recurrence will eventually die of prostate cancer, while others will have indolent disease and ultimately die of other causes. Prognosis is best estimated by considering initial stage, Gleason grade, and PSA in addition to the absolute value of the PSA at the time of recurrence and the PSA-doubling time. PSA-doubling time has been shown to be a useful parameter for monitoring patients and deciding when to initiate treatment after biochemical recurrence. PSA-doubling time of fewer than or equal to 3 months predicts cancer-specific mortality among patients with biochemical recurrence after either RP or EBRT.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Salvage Local Therapy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Approximately 20% to 25% of men with local recurrence postprostatectomy can be cured with early salvage EBRT. Several factors predict long-term response to salvage ERBT: Gleason score less than or equal to 7, positive surgical margins at RP, negative nodal or seminal vesicle involvement, and post-RP PSA kinetics consistent with local failure. Patients who recur immediately after definitive radiation therapy are candidates for ADT, observation, or, in selected cases, salvage prostatectomy.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ADVANCED DISEASE</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A positive bone scan and pain in a weightbearing area correlating to the scan should prompt an x-ray to assess for impending pathologic fractures. Patients</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should be made nonweightbearing and immediately referred for both surgical and radiation consultation. The possibility of cord compression should be suspected in any man with a history of prostate cancer and new-onset back pain. Pain from spinal cord compression is often severe and generally predates neurologic symptoms. A negative neurologic examination should not delay a definitive radiologic study (preferably MRI or CT myelogram), and patients with suspected cord compression should be initiated and maintained on steroids until compression is ruled out.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hormonal Therapy</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First-line hormonal the rapy <span class="p">Patients with advanced disease at presentation, or patients who relapse after definitive local therapy are initially treated with some form of ADT. The timing of hormonal therapy for a biochemical recurrence after definitive therapy is controversial. Early initiation of ADT in these patients reduced prostate cancer–specific mortality (17% relative risk) when compared to symptom-driven initiation. However, overall mortality was similar in both groups. Without clear guidelines, ADT is typically initiated based on PSA-doubling time, Gleason score, and patient preferences. Hormonal therapy for patients with advanced disease is usually initiated at presentation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The goal of ADT is to decrease the level of testosterone available to potentiate growth of the prostate cancer cells. A variety of treatments can achieve this goal; <span class="s1">Table 90-3 </span>outlines the spectrum of drugs, which either alone or in combination are used as ADT. Currently, the majority of men on ADT are treated with luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antagonists alone (monotherapy) or in combination with an antiandrogen (combined androgen blockade). Although some physicians routinely use combination therapy, others prefer LHRH monotherapy, and there are no clear data showing benefit of one strategy over the other.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Patients with known metastatic disease, however, need to be on an</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">antiandrogen for at least 30 days, starting 7 to 10 days prior to initiation of LHRH agonist therapy to avoid the initial testosterone flare associated with LHRH therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 90-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>COMMONLY USED HORMONAL THERAPY OPTIONS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Orchiectomy (surgical castration) is an underused and underappreciated form of hormonal treatment. Morbidity associated with the procedure currently is minimal and barring unforeseen complications, it is an outpatient procedure. Data from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study provided an update on QoL issues for patients receiving hormonal therapy. Men who chose LHRH agonist therapy reported greater problems than orchiectomy patients did with their overall sexual functioning, despite both groups having similar levels of function prior to beginning treatment. LHRH patients were also less likely to perceive themselves as free of cancer, likely because of the need for ongoing injections.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The duration of response to first-line ADT is typically 18 to 24 months, although patients who initiate therapy for biochemical relapse alone may show PSA responses for much longer. The continuation of ADT in the setting of hormone-refractory disease is a subject of some controversy. Given the potential for improved survival for patients remaining on testicular androgen suppression, many physicians continue to administer LHRH agonists for the duration of treatment with secondary hormonal therapies and chemotherapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Side effects from hormonal therapies include hot flashes, insomnia, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, weight gain/fluid retention, diabetes, increased risk of cardiovascular events, and breast enlargement/nipple tenderness. Breast enlargement can be curtailed, although not reversed, by a few treatments of electron beam radiation directly to the breast stem cells underneath the areola. This low-risk treatment can provide significant physical and psychological benefit. Antiandrogen treatment can lead to hepatic dysfunction, requiring monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) after the initial month of therapy, and every 3 months thereafter. Antiandrogens are also associated with gastrointestinal effects, including nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. Estrogens can predispose patients to thromboembolic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">complications, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with decreased testosterone caused by orchiectomy or ADT also have a significantly increased risk of bone loss. Most studies have demonstrated a 2% to 3% decrease per year in bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine during initial testosterone suppressing therapy, and BMD continues to decline during long-term therapy. Fracture rates are also higher in patients on ADT. Three large, claims-based studies have shown that LHRH treatment is independently associated with fracture risk. Patients on testosterone suppressing therapy should, therefore, be encouraged to take daily calcium (500 mg) and vitamin D (400 IU) supplements to prevent bone loss. In addition, patients may benefit from BMD testing to evaluate overall bone health. Men with osteopenia or osteoporosis should be considered for treatment with oral bisphosphonates (see section on “Supportive Care”).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intermittent androgen deprivation <span class="p">Intermittent androgen blockade has been advocated as a way to decrease side effects from ADT and also to, potentially, increase the time to androgen independence. With this strategy, patients are cycled on and off hormonal therapy based on PSA response.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once patients achieve an undetectable PSA in response to ADT, they are taken off therapy and monitored; treatment is reinitiated based on absolute PSA value and/or PSA-doubling time. Two prospective trials found that intermittent therapy was noninferior to continuous treatment for the primary outcome of overall survival. Additionally, QoL indicators were better in the intermittent treatment group in one trial.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Second-line hormonal the rapy <span class="p">Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is defined as a rising PSA (or radiographic progression) with a castrate level of serum testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) and after withdrawal or addition of an antiandrogen. For instance, if the CRPC patient is receiving combined androgen blockade (ie, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist and antiandrogen), the next step is antiandrogen withdrawal. The maximum duration of response is approximately 5 months. To date, there have been no identified predictors of androgen withdrawal response, although a longer duration of treatment with flutamide has been associated with response in two larger trials.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Since 2010, there have been several new antineoplastic agents that have shown a survival benefit in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). In the majority of instances, a medical oncologist will manage the treatment regimens</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">described below. However, recognizing the side effects of each treatment is paramount in the care provided by the geriatrician, which may require a dose adjustment or cessation of therapy. Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are approved for the treatment of mCRPC, both of which target androgen signaling. Abiraterone acetate is an irreversible inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoform-17 (CYP17), a key enzyme for androgen synthesis in the testes and adrenal glands. The precursor to abiraterone acetate, ketoconazole, can inhibit multiple P450 enzymes resulting in off-target effects and toxicities. In combination with prednisone, abiraterone acetate increases overall survival. Its ability to inhibit androgen synthesis can lead to mineralocorticoid excess, resulting in edema (31%), hypokalemia (17%), and hypertension (10%).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Less common side effects are LFT elevations and cardiac abnormalities (tachycardia, atrial fibrillation). In addition to the survival benefit, abiraterone acetate delayed the use of opioids for pain and skeletal-related events. Enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide are androgen receptor antagonists, which prevent androgen from binding to the receptor and also inhibit nuclear translocation of the receptor. Similar to abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide increased overall survival regardless of chemotherapy status. Common side effects include fatigue, headaches, and hot flashes. Seizures were observed in approximately 1% of patients so these drugs should be used with caution in patients with a known seizure disorder. Since enzalutamide is used without prednisone, the side effects of mineralocorticoid excess are not seen. The most effective sequence of abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide is not known and may be dictated by the side effect profile of each medication or physician preference.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Estrogens, such as diethylstilbestrol, have shown promise both singly and in combination, although estrogen therapy is associated with side effects such as edema and thromboembolic complications. Judicious use of prophylactic agents, such as warfarin or low-dose aspirin, has been included in estrogen trials, but not prospectively. With the development of next-generation androgen signaling antagonists, use of estrogens has fallen out of favor.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The decision to pursue secondary hormonal manipulations will likely depend on several factors. Available data suggest that patients with a significant and prolonged response to initial hormonal therapy, or a significant antiandrogen withdrawal response, may be good candidates for a trial of secondary hormonal therapy. Poor functional status and the presence of other medical problems may render attempts at further hormonal</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">manipulation an attractive option, as these patients are often intolerant of the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Patients with rapid PSA-doubling times are likely to have more aggressive disease and may receive more benefit from chemotherapy or a clinical trial with a novel agent.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemotherapy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemotherapy still has an important role in mCRPC after progressing through the multiple lines of hormonal therapy. Although mCRPC was once labeled “chemotherapy resistant,” a number of agents now show great promise in both palliative and response end points. Docetaxel is the first chemotherapeutic agent with demonstrated survival benefit in prostate cancer and has become standard of care for first-line therapy in castration-resistant disease. Mitoxantrone with prednisone has demonstrated palliative benefits in patients with bone metastases and is generally well tolerated. However, mitoxantrone has been supplanted by cabazitaxel as second-line chemotherapy. Cabazitaxel is a semisynthetic taxane with a similar mechanism to docetaxel. It increased overall survival when compared to mitoxantrone in the post-docetaxel setting. Mitoxantrone is currently third- line chemotherapy and used less frequently due to side effects and lack of survival benefit.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radium-223</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radium-223 dichloride is an α-particle emitter, and it is the only bone- specific FDA-approved drug for mCRPC that is associated with a survival benefit. It selectively targets bone metastases, as it gets built into hydroxyapatite as a calcium substitute. In one trial, radium-223 improved median survival by 3.6 months, prolonged time to first skeletal event, and improved pain scores and QoL. However, in a more recent trial, the addition of radium-223 to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone did not improve symptomatic skeletal event-free survival in patients with mCRPC, and was associated with an increased frequency of bone fractures compared with placebo.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sipuleucel-T</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sipuleucel-T was the first active cellular immunostimulant approved as a first-line therapy for non- to minimally symptomatic mCRPC. Mononuclear blood cells are harvested through leukapheresis. Antigen-presenting cells are</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">activated with the antigen prostatic acid phosphatase and granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor ex vivo. The autologous, activated product is reinfused three times. One sipuleucel-T trial demonstrated a 4.1- month increase in survival. However, no PSA decline was observed, and there was no difference in the progression-free survival (PFS) in the treatment group compared to placebo.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Poly (ADP Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown high rates of response in men with somatic and/or germline homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency. There are two PARP inhibitors that have been approved by the US FDA. Olaparib is approved for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic HRR gene-mutated mCRPC, who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone. The most common adverse events of olaparib are anemia, nausea, decreased appetite, and fatigue. Rucaparib is approved for patients with a germline and/or somatic deleterious <i>BRCA </i>mutation-associated mCRPC who have been treated with AR-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SUPPORTIVE CARE</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bisphosphonates/RANKL Inhibitors</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogues of inorganic pyrophosphates with high avidity for calcium and areas of bone mineralization (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 51 </span>for a full discussion of these drugs). Although various bisphosphonates have been tested in multiple clinical trials in the setting of advanced prostate cancer, only zoledronic acid- has a demonstrated effect on bone metastases in this population. Intravenous zoledronic acid is generally well tolerated, though patients should have regular creatinine assessment as renal insufficiency is a contraindication for zoledronic acid and renal toxicity is a known, but relatively uncommon, side effect. In addition, bisphosphonate use is rarely associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw—so patients should have a dental examination prior to initiating therapy, and clinicians should ask patients regularly about their dental health.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As both increasing age and ADT place men at higher risk of osteoporosis, bisphosphonates may also be useful in prevention of secondary fractures in this population. Furthermore, bone is a major target for prostate</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cancer metastases. Thus, bone protection should be paramount, especially in the early stages of the disease. Zoledronic acid is commonly used in the outpatient setting in patients with bone metastases.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the RANK ligand to prevent pathologic fracture and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Denosumab was shown to be noninferior to zoledronic acid with respect to preventing skeletal-related events in men with mCRPC. Denosumab can be administered as a subcutaneous injection and used safely in patients with renal insufficiency.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pain Control</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The majority of men with advanced prostate cancer have bone metastases, which are frequently very painful. Pain control is thus a critical issue in these patients and needs to be frequently monitored. Bone pain generally responds well to treatment with both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, used alone or in combination. Although some older patients are very tolerant of narcotic analgesics, as a rule they should be started on low doses with careful dose titration and individualized treatment plans to achieve maximal analgesia and maintain QoL. Constipation, the most common side</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">effect of pain medications, should be aggressively addressed, but is generally well controlled with laxatives.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative Radiation and Systemic Radioisotopes</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative radiation therapy can provide significant pain relief for symptomatic bone metastases and is also used to prevent impending pathologic fracture. Thus, patients with one or two areas of severe bone pain, which is either inadequately controlled with narcotics or which requires unacceptably high doses of narcotics, should be referred to radiation oncology for consultation. Most palliative radiation is given in one to 10 dose fractions, and 80% to 90% of prostate cancer patients who receive palliative radiation for bone metastases experience significant and durable pain relief. The onset of pain relief may be as soon as 48 hours after the initiation of therapy, although some patients will not experience maximal relief for up to 2 weeks after therapy is complete. Systemic radioisotopes can deliver high-dose radiation to bone lesions without significantly affecting normal bone and can provide palliative benefit to patients with widespread, painful bone metastases, which are refractory to palliative chemotherapy or</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">narcotic analgesia. Strontium-89 and samarium-153 are both β-emitters that are FDA-approved for palliation and pain relief. These agents have the potential to cause significant myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia. More recently, the calcium mimetic radium-223 was shown to increase overall survival as well as provide pain relief, making it an attractive treatment for castration-resistant, symptomatic, bony metastases. Radium-223 is an α- emitter, which can transmit higher energy over shorter distances compared to β-emitters, making this treatment more effective with less side effects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Andriole GL, Crawford ED, Grubb RL 3rd, et al.

More patients die from lung cancer than from colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. In 2021, it is estimated there will be 235,760 new cases of lung cancer with 69,410 men and 62,470 women dying from their disease. Lung cancer–associated deaths have been declining and have contributed to the overall decline in the cancer-related death rate from 2014 to 2018. This decline in the lung cancer death rate is attributable to several changes: (1) a decrease in smoking rates, (2) the advent of new therapies in lung cancer, and (3) the introduction of screening for high-risk populations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The risk of lung cancer increases with age. The median age at diagnosis is 71 years. By the year 2034, it is projected that there will be 77 million people 65 years or older, an almost 80% increase since 2012. This combination of a burgeoning geriatric population and newly recommended annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan screening will increase the number of older adults needing evaluation and treatment for lung cancer. Despite advances in screening for high-risk individuals, the majority (75%) of lung cancer is diagnosed with either spread to regional lymph nodes or distant sites (ie, stage III or IV).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The major modifiable risk factor for the development of lung cancer is tobacco use, accounting for approximately 80% of lung cancer cases.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smokers and nonsmokers are at risk for lung cancer; however, the risk is much higher (10-fold) among patients who have smoked cigarettes. The risk is directly proportional to the number of pack-years and tar content. Patients</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">exposed to passive tobacco smoke are also at risk, accounting for 25% of lung cancer cases. Men or women who smoke cigars and pipes are at an increased risk as well; however, their risk may be less than that of cigarette smokers. Smoking cessation even in long-time smokers decreases the risk of lung cancer development and is a major public health priority.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Lung cancer in never-smokers accounts for approximately 13% of patients with lung cancers in the United States, disproportionately affecting women. Never-smokers are more likely to have activating genetic alterations such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>) or chromosomal rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). These patients are treated with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the specific mutation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aside from the activating mutations in oncogenes, other possible pathogenic theories for lung cancer in never-smokers include exposure to environmental or occupational etiologic factors such as asbestos or radon. Occupational and environmental exposures are important questions to ask patients particularly if they have worked in construction, naval shipyards, or live in areas with high air pollution, diesel exhaust, or smoke from cooking and heating. Prior radiation therapy to the chest for other malignancies also increases the risk of a second primary lung cancer, particularly among smokers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><ul id="l5"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Become familiar with the general principles of lung cancer evaluation and its inherent need for a multidisciplinary approach to management.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Identify the broad treatment paradigms for different stages of lung cancer, including more recent developments in therapeutics and their potential side effects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><h3 style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">1.

Two randomized trials have reported statistically significant reductions in lung cancer mortality associated with LDCT screening. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) in the United States demonstrated that screening higher-risk persons (30+ pack-years and either current smokers or quit within the past 15 years) aged 55 to 74 years annually for 3 years with LDCTs reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8%–26.7%; <i>p </i>= .004) and all-cause mortality by 6.7% (95% CI, 1.2%–13.6%; <i>p </i>= .02) over screening with chest radiographs. An updated analysis showed that the estimated reduction in lung cancer mortality was 16% (95% CI, 5%–25%). The NELSON Netherlands trial reported that among high-risk current and former smokers, men who were randomly assigned to four rounds of LDCT screening had a 24% reduction (95% CI,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6%–39%) in lung cancer mortality compared with men who were randomly assigned to no screening. These two large randomized trials (NLST and NELSON) found that the average false-positive rate per screening round was 23.3% and 10.4%, respectively. Using a more recent definition of a positive LDCT screening on the basis of the Lung-RADS criteria yields a false- positive rate that may be somewhat lower than that seen in the NLST. A total of 0.06% of all false-positive screening results in the NLST led to a major complication after an invasive procedure was performed as a diagnostic follow-up to the screening. Over three screening rounds, 1.8% of NLST participants who did not have lung cancer had an invasive procedure after a positive screening result. An extended follow-up analysis of the NLST reported data after a median of 12.3 years of follow-up for mortality. The estimated number needed to screen with LDCT to prevent one lung cancer death was 303.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Based on the decrease in lung cancer–associated mortality in screening trials, in December 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released its updated recommendations to perform annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT scans in adults aged 55 to 80 who have a 30-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ideally, most cancers would be diagnosed at an early stage; however, among older adults with increasing comorbidity, it is critical to understand the impact of undergoing screening as they may be more likely to die from other comorbid conditions and not from cancer. The impact of these screening guidelines remains to be determined with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of early-stage lung cancers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Veterans Administration (VA) have approved health care coverage for this screening recommendation. The issues of lead- time bias and additional morbidity and mortality are particularly relevant in the population of older adults in whom competing causes of death and multiple comorbidities are frequently encountered. In addition to the overdiagnosis of small tumors detected during screening, which could otherwise remain silent until the patient dies from other causes, screening for lung cancer with LDCT could potentially cause harm secondary to morbidity and mortality associated with biopsies and surgery, since lung tumors often appear as noncalcified nodules. In the NLST trial, only 25% of patient enrolled in the screening arms were age 65 to 74 and less than 1% were 75 years or older. Over 96% of the patients with a positive screen had a false-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">positive result after further work-up. This has important implications for screening among the oldest old patients with comorbid conditions. Among older adults, there is a higher risk for false-positive LDCT screening findings. Despite screening being endorsed as a new standard of care (SOC) for high-risk individuals, the regional utilization of LDCT screening for lung cancer varies considerably within the United States. Adults aged 65 to 74 seem somewhat more likely to utilize it in addition to those with prior cancer diagnoses as well as underlying respiratory illnesses. In another report, age was not associated with lung cancer screening, but retired status and presence of a personal physician were associated with receipt of screening. Other barriers may include a lack of physician awareness and resources as well as the requirement of a shared decision-making visit prior to screening.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PATHOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lung cancer is broadly characterized into non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) versus small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) (<span class="s1">Table 91-1</span>). Distinguishing between these two histopathology subtypes is critical as the subtype dictates treatment course. For example, SCLC is more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation, may require prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), and often has a more aggressive clinical course compared to NSCLC. NSCLC is the most common subtype accounting for up to 85% of diagnoses. Among NSCLC, adenocarcinoma accounts for the most common histologic type followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Less prevalent subtypes recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) include large-cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and carcinoid tumors.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bronchoalveolar carcinoma is currently classified under adenocarcinoma. Multiple conceptual changes have been incorporated within the updated pathological classification. These include the use of immunohistochemistry throughout the classification, an emphasis on genetic studies, and in particular, the integration of molecular testing to help personalize treatment strategies for patients with advanced lung.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 91-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>OVERVIEW OF LUNG CANCER STAGING, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND TREATMENT</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Adenocarcinoma is classically a peripheral, solitary lung nodule, often associated with malignant pleural effusion and early development of metastases frequently involving the brain and bone. Squamous cell carcinoma classically is central in location, endobronchial in nature, sometimes with central cavitation, and commonly associated with lobar collapse, obstructive pneumonia, or hemoptysis, with relatively late development of distant metastases. SCLC has the strongest association with smoking and commonly forms rapidly growing, central masses. The pathologic classification of lung cancer is evolving due to new sampling and radiologic techniques, molecular biomarkers, and histologic/pathologic advances. In 2011, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society International (IASLC/ATC/ERSI) developed a multidisciplinary international team to iteratively incorporate advances in the molecular and histologic lung cancer subtypes of resection specimens, small biopsies, and cytology into a new, separate classification schema from the WHO. Mutational analysis is now routinely done on adenocarcinomas as</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">oral targeted therapies exist for multiple actionable mutations (see Molecular Markers).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The initial clinical presentation of lung cancer patients is evolving. With new screening guidelines and regular use of chest CT scans for several medical indications, many new lung cancers are diagnosed during evaluation of incidental pulmonary nodules that require serial follow-up CT scans. Despite these practice changes, patients still present with classic symptoms of cough, unintentional weight loss, and/or hemoptysis. Symptoms related to the primary tumor depend on the location of the tumor. Central tumors produce cough, dyspnea, hoarseness, stridor, hemoptysis, and postobstructive pneumonia. Superior sulcus tumors may produce shoulder pain, arm pain, brachial plexopathy, or Horner syndrome. Peripheral lesions may cause pleuritic chest pain due to pleural involvement. Symptoms related to mediastinal disease include hoarseness caused by the involvement of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve with left-sided tumors and obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC) with right-sided tumors or associated lymphadenopathy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Because more than half of patients have metastases at presentation, initial symptoms related to a metastatic site are frequent, particularly in patients with adenocarcinoma or small-cell carcinoma. Often, the initial presentation is due to symptomatic brain metastases and associated vasogenic edema causing seizures, new headaches, or neurologic deficits. Subsequent metastases from lung cancer are common. Sites of spread include the brain, pleura, bone, liver, adrenal glands, and contralateral lung. Rarely, lung cancer is diagnosed due to a paraneoplastic syndrome such as hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy leading to hypercalcemia in squamous cell carcinoma. SCLCs are known to cause syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, Cushing syndrome, and various neurologic syndromes such as Eaton-Lambert reverse myasthenia syndrome, among others. More commonly in advanced disease, hypercoagulability results in venous thromboembolic disease either concomitantly at the time of diagnosis or during the disease trajectory.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Special Presentation Issues</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lung cancer is unique in that it can present in several ways including but not limited to superior sulcus (Pancoast) tumors, chest wall tumors, or solitary brain metastases. Superior sulcus tumors are carcinomas that develop in the apex of the lung with invasion into the thoracic inlet. The most common initial symptom is shoulder pain due to invasion of the brachial plexus. This invasion into the sympathetic chain and stellate ganglion is termed Horner syndrome, the classic triad of miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis. Chest wall tumors are bulky primary lung tumors that directly invade the chest wall.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment options for both superior sulcus and chest wall tumors include combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A third unique presentation is SVC syndrome in which edema develops in the face and neck with dilated veins in the neck and torso due to compression of the SVC outlet. SCLC is a common histology encountered with this presentation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Urgent treatment measures include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or a vascular stent to relieve the obstruction. Lastly, patients who present with solitary brain metastases after curative treatment intent for early-stage NSCLC, are eligible for resection of the solitary metastases, achieving prolonged disease-free survival in the absence of other distant metastatic disease. Performance status (PS), extent of extracranial disease, and age are key prognostic factors in this scenario. If the metastasis is not causing symptoms, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the preferred modality but for symptomatic patients, or if histologic evaluation is warranted, surgical resection followed by radiation in the form of whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or SRS is appropriate. Notably, one-half of patients treated with resection and postoperative radiation therapy will develop recurrence in the brain. SRS is preferred over WBRT as it spares late cognitive side effects of WBRT and can be performed on more than one intracranial site in the event of subsequent metastases. However, if SRS is not an option due to presence of multiple larger tumors or multiple areas previously treated with SRS, then WBRT can be considered as a palliative measure.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic Approaches</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although patients may present with symptoms outlined above, it is becoming increasingly common for solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) being detected on chest x-ray and/or CT scans of the chest that are ordered for other</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">indications. The pretest probability of SPNs being benign or malignant depends on several factors, including the size and appearance of the nodule, as well as patient risk factors including smoking exposure. Assessing for dynamic changes of an SPN over serial CT imaging may be recommended at first if there is a low or intermediate level of suspicion. If the clinical suspicion is high and CT imaging supports an early-stage process, patients may be eligible for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) via wedge resection or lobectomy that may be both diagnostic and therapeutic if lung cancer is confirmed. Otherwise transthoracic imaging-guided biopsies or transbronchial biopsies of SPN or thoracic lymph nodes via bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), respectively, may be indicated to obtain a tissue diagnosis. The general principles of diagnostic evaluation include electing the least invasive biopsy with the likelihood for highest yield as the first biopsy. Patients with central masses are best addressed via bronchoscopy while peripheral nodules (outer third) will likely benefit from navigational bronchoscopy, radial EBUS, or transthoracic needle aspiration. Patients with suspected nodal involvement by imaging may be biopsied using EBUS, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), navigational bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy. Lymph node sampling is essential for accurate pathologic staging. Certainly, if more distant lesions are noted in the liver or elsewhere that may be more accessible to a percutaneous approach, this ought to be considered as well. Finally, in patients with a suspected malignant pleural effusion, thoracentesis with cytologic evaluation may provide sufficient material to render a diagnosis. A single negative cytology result does not exclude pleural involvement, and in the presence of an effusion, additional thoracentesis or thoracoscopic evaluation should be performed.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Staging Work-Up</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When there is strong clinical suspicion for lung cancer and/or whenever a diagnosis of lung cancer is confirmed, CT staging imaging of the chest and abdomen (ie, liver and adrenal glands) is needed. Current guidelines also warrant brain imaging even among patients with suspected early-stage disease, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and especially for those with confirmed SCLC. Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is mostly incorporated in the evaluation of patients with potentially resectable early-stage NSCLC (stages I–II) and some cases of stage IIIA, for which a noninvasive evaluation of the mediastinal lymph</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nodes (ie, N2 disease) can be important in surgical and nonsurgical treatment planning. EBUS and EUS are less invasive approaches to evaluating hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on staging imaging to guide treatment planning and are becoming more readily adopted into pathologic staging approaches. However, patients may still need mediastinoscopy (ie, surgical staging) prior to surgery if there are concerns about accessibility or yield by EBUS/EUS, particularly in NSCLC arising from the left upper lobe.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">If metastatic disease is identified on initial CT staging imaging, a PET/CT is unlikely to change management. Evaluation for brain metastases with MRI or contrast-infused CT is indicated for any SCLC diagnosis, and patients with stage III or IV NSCLC, or in any patient with suggestive signs or symptoms regardless of stage. Since SCLC is still conventionally staged into limited versus extensive stage (see “Small-Cell Lung Cancer”), this distinction invariably can be made with staging imaging alone since the treatment of choice is nonsurgical with the rare exception of resection of early-stage SPNs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Once the diagnosis and stage have been established, in addition to a comprehensive history and physical examination with special focus on antecedent weight loss, PS, and comorbid conditions, it is essential to assess whether an older adult is a candidate for cancer treatment based on overall life expectancy. It is essential to assess decision-making capacity given the complexity of risk-benefit decisions of choosing cancer treatment options as well as the patient’s goals and preferences. If a decision is made to proceed with cancer treatment, then side effects and potential toxicities are addressed.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Molecular Markers</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The past decade has seen the emergence of molecular testing that has furthered our understanding of lung cancer biology and accelerated the development of targeted therapies against identified oncogenic driver mutations. A significant proportion of patients have tumors with a therapeutically targetable molecular abnormality, the vast majority of which occur in lung adenocarcinomas. Multiple organizations, including the IASLC, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the College of American Pathologists, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, have issued guidelines for molecular testing as an important first step to determining therapy in NSCLC. Mutational testing of genes including <i>EGFR, ALK, ROS1,</i></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RET, MET, NTRK<span class="p">, and </span>BRAF <span class="p">is currently standard for all patients with advanced NSCLC. Further testing is encouraged to include </span>ERBB2 <span class="p">and </span>KRAS<span class="p">, given it informs tumor biology, prognosis, and systemic therapy. Due to the ever-growing number of recommended molecular tests for lung cancer, multigene panel testing using next-generation sequencing is cost-effective compared with sequential individual gene testing and is covered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TREATMENT OF NON–SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Early Stages (I and II)</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stage I and II patients account for approximately 30% of NSCLC cases, corresponding to a 5-year overall survival rate of 53% to 92%. Depending on a patient’s comorbidity burden and pulmonary function status, a curative treatment approach with either radiation or surgery is pursued for those with NSCLC (see <span class="s1">Table 91-1</span>). For fit patients, the treatment of choice is surgical resection of the tumor, resulting in cure for many patients, and preferably done by lobectomy, as a more limited resection (segmentectomy or wedge resection) is associated with increased local recurrence and decreased survival. Either open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery access can be considered, although the latter is a more attractive approach for patients because of a reduced postoperative pain and improved quality of life.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For patients with coexisting medical conditions, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or heart disease, thoracic surgery is often not an option and is considered medically inoperable disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, the 3-year overall survival for medically inoperable disease remains low (20%–35%) with conventional radiation treatment or observation alone. However, the more recent use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) over conventional radiotherapy allows the delivery of focused and ablative radiation doses over a few fractions to the primary lung tumor with lower toxicity. Prospective trials of SBRT in medically inoperable candidates showed local control rates exceeding 92% with limited toxicity, and a 3-year disease control rate and overall survival of 48% to 76% and 56% to 60%, respectively. Population studies showed a significant reduction of untreated early-stage NSCLC with the introduction of SBRT among older adults, translating to a survival benefit. Recently, a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pooled analysis from two randomized studies, StereoTactic Radiotherapy versus Surgery (STARS) and Radiosurgery or Surgery for Operable Early- Stage Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer (ROSEL), compared lobectomy to SBRT in medically operable patients and found no difference in local control but a statistically significant 3-year overall survival of 79% for surgery versus 95% for SBRT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.14; 95% CI 0.017–1.190; <i>p </i>= 0.037).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This observed overall survival benefit could be attributed to postsurgical mortality.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Even with excellent local control rates after curative-intent surgery or SBRT, the risk of systemic failure is high and varies considerably by disease stage. Patients with stage II NSCLC (including tumor size &gt; 4 cm and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph node) are at higher risk for recurrence than those with stage I, and are most likely to derive benefit from postoperative (ie, adjuvant) chemotherapy to improve cancer-specific mortality. Adjuvant chemotherapy utilizing cisplatin-based doublets has improved cancer-related and overall survival, but no single preferred regimen has been established.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Preoperative (ie, neoadjuvant) chemotherapy may allow the delivery of more cycles of chemotherapy without interruption or delay due to toxicities but has not been shown to improve outcomes compared to postoperative administration. However, many of these seminal trials evaluating postoperative chemotherapy enrolled patients with a median age of 60 to 65 years, excluding those 75 years or older, or incorporated cisplatin-based regimens, which may be more difficult for older adults to tolerate, particularly those with age- and/or comorbidity-related renal dysfunction. To date, large, prospective trials evaluating carboplatin-based regimens remain sparse. Regardless of chemotherapy regimen choice, a clinical benefit still remains in selecting older adults with stage II disease who experienced a proper recovery from surgery, good PS, and no significant comorbidities.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While older adults may be slower to recover from surgery and face a higher risk for postoperative complications, a recent analysis of the National Cancer Database showed that delayed adjuvant chemotherapy administration upon recovery after surgery remains efficacious. Unlike for surgery, currently, there are no data to support adjuvant chemotherapy after SBRT in early-stage NSCLC.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Routine incorporation of postoperative radiation after curative resection has been shown to benefit overall survival. Postoperative radiation therapy should be considered in patients with a positive surgical margin. However,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for those upstaged to IIIA disease due to mediastinal nodal (ie, N2) involvement, the LungART study showed higher cardiopulmonary toxicity related to postoperative radiation therapy delivery with no 3-year disease- free survival and overall survival advantage. The publication from this trial is pending, yet some institutions have started to change their current practice.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stage III</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with stage III NSCLC remain a clinically heterogeneous patient population necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to navigate the multiple surgical, radiation, and chemotherapy treatments available. Patients with stage III NSCLC due to chest wall involvement with limited or no nodal involvement should be assessed for surgical resection because of improved local control. However, stage III is usually attributable to mediastinal nodal involvement and thus precludes upfront surgical resection. Therefore, accurate mediastinal staging is essential in clinically appearing early-stage disease with the incorporation of PET/CT imaging for staging and pathologic confirmation by tissue either by EBUS-guided biopsy and/or surgically by mediastinoscopy when appropriate. Preoperative chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation for potentially resectable disease has led to conflicting results in cancer-related survival. Those patients able to undergo lobectomy (as opposed to pneumonectomy) after preoperative chemoradiation can achieve a median overall survival rate of 2 to 3 years, depending on pathologic mediastinal nodal response, as opposed to 12 to 18 months typically reported with definitive chemoradiation alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For unresectable IIIA disease or stage IIIB disease (due to contralateral hilar or mediastinal nodal disease), more functionally fit patients are usually offered definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy. However, concurrent chemoradiation significantly increases the risk of short-term radiation toxicities such as esophagitis as well as neutropenia that may be more difficult to tolerate in vulnerable older adults. Although the absolute benefit of concurrent versus sequential therapy is relatively small in younger adults, it can still be seen in select older adults (ie, age ≥ 70) as evidenced in several subset analyses of phase III clinical trials. Consolidation chemotherapy after chemoradiation remains a controversial area, but data are accumulating that older adults with stage III NSCLC may not benefit from this additional treatment. There were two significant advances, namely consolidation with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) after concurrent</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">chemoradiation and the use of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), osimertinib, for EGFR mutant resected NSCLC.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In the PACIFIC trial, 713 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who had disease control after concurrent chemoradiation were randomized 2 to 1 to durvalumab (an ICI) 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or placebo for 12 months. After a median follow-up of 25.2 months, durvalumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival from 16.8 months to 5.6 months (HR 0.52; 95 % CI, 0.42 to 0.65: <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001). In an updated analysis after 3 years of follow-up, the median overall survival was not reached with durvalumab compared to 29.1 months with placebo (HR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.86; <i>p </i>= 0.0025). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were noted in 29.9% of patients in the durvalumab arm compared to 26.1% in the placebo arm. Given acceptable tolerability and the survival benefit, durvalumab has become the new SOC.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The other major breakthrough is the introduction of targeted therapy to early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC. In the ADAURA study, 682 patients with resected IB, II, or III NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to osimertinib or placebo for 3 years. The disease-free survival in stage II–IIIA patients, the primary endpoint, was not reached in the osimertinib arm compared with 20.4 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.12– 0.23; <i>p </i>&lt; .0001). Results showed that the EGFR-targeted therapy with osimertinib reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 83% in this patient population. Although adapting the results of this study is still under debate, given the lack of overall survival benefit and concerns about long- term toxicity and financial burden, it highlights the importance of performing molecular testing in all stages of NSCLC cases to identify candidates for targeted therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Because of the treatment intensity involved, among older adults, geriatric assessments play an important clinical role in the selection of those patients who are most likely to benefit from more intensive combined modality treatment since no prospective data exist to guide decision-making.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Optimization of comorbidities, functional status, cancer symptoms, social support, and geriatric syndromes would prove useful because of the increased morbidity of these therapeutic approaches employed in stage III NSCLC.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stage IV</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over half of patients with NSCLC will have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis, for which the goal of treatment is palliative, not curative.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Platinum-based doublets have been the SOC as first-line therapy, showing improved survival and quality of life among fit older patients. In the last decade, the identification of activating molecular alterations and the development of new targeted therapies and ICI have changed the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Initial molecular testing of the tumor sample to determine therapy in NSCLC is endorsed by multiple organizations and considered a SOC. In the absence of molecular alteration, early incorporation of immunotherapy guided by the tumor proportion score of programmed death- ligand 1 (PD-L1) improves overall survival. In addition, the early introduction of palliative and supportive care remains a main cornerstone of lung cancer treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">When a molecular alteration is identified (ie, <i>EGFR, ALK</i>), targeting the mutation results in better disease control, improved quality of life, and longer progression-free survival compared to standard chemotherapy. Molecular alterations are usually mutually exclusive and more common in patients identified as either never-smokers, longtime ex-smokers, or light smokers (&lt; 15 packs per year), but they can be found among patients with a smoking history. Association between molecular alteration and age is not strongly established, yet <i>MET </i>skip mutation tends to have a higher prevalence in older women. There are currently multiple biomarkers with effective matched targeted therapy approved by the FDA in the settings of advanced NSCLC. Due to the high efficacy and favorable toxicity profile of those agents, clinical trials have frequently included older adults.

8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>) is the most established genomic biomarker in NSCLC, with multiple effective <i>EGFR </i>tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib and erlotinib (first-generation), afatinib and dacomitinib (second-generation), and osimertinib (third-generation). The two main sensitizing mutations are <i>EGFR L858R </i>and <i>EGFR </i>exon 19 deletion. Multiple studies compared first-generation <i>EGFR </i>TKIs with chemotherapy, and later with second-generation TKIs showing superior results. In subgroup analyses, these trials showed that TKIs had comparable benefits in older adults (aged &gt; 65 years), but analyses of toxicities specific to older adults were not reported. Retrospective studies showed that although generally well tolerated, older adults treated with first-generation TKIs encountered more adverse events requiring dose reduction. Osimertinib is a third-generation TKI that selectively inhibits <i>EGFR</i>-sensitizing mutation and <i>EGFR Thr790Met </i>(T790M) mutation, which is the most common acquired resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs. Recently, osimertinib was approved as an initial therapy for <i>EGFR</i>-mutant NSCLC, based on the FLAURA trial that showed superior outcomes, improved overall survival,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and efficacy in patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Around 46% of the enrolled patients were 65 years or older, and the benefit of osimertinib was maintained. Unlike first-generation TKIs, osimertinib is more tolerable with a favorable toxicity profile. Further NSCLC FDA- approved matched therapies to actionable mutations in NSCLC are listed in <span class="s1">Table 91-2</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The introduction of ICIs targeting the PD-1 or PD-L1 changed the treatment paradigm of advanced NSCLC without molecular alteration. The KEYNOTE-024 trial established pembrolizumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) as an initial therapy for patients with a PD-L1 score of 50% or greater who did not have <i>EGFR </i>mutations or <i>ALK </i>gene rearrangements. More than 50% of patients enrolled in the study were older than 65 years. Pembrolizumab showed a superior response and overall survival benefit compared to systemic chemotherapy in all age subgroups (<span class="s1">Table 91-3</span>). It also has a lower frequency of severe adverse events (27%) compared to chemotherapy (53%). Unlike conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAEs) are associated with nonspecific autoimmune reactions or inflammation to any given organ, and occur mostly in the skin, colon, thyroid, lung, pituitary gland, and liver. The majority of irAEs can be managed successfully with steroids and discontinuation of ICI. Two ongoing phase II clinical trials (CheckMate 153 and CheckMate 171) evaluated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) in patients older than 75 years and showed similar rates of irAE between younger versus older adults.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">TABLE 91-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>FIRST-LINE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC NON–SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER WITHOUT TARGETABLE MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">After the introduction of pembrolizumab in biomarker-selected patients (PD-L1 &gt; 50%), randomized trials with a regimen of ICI and systemic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">chemotherapy showed that this combination was an effective strategy. The KEYNOTE-189 trial demonstrated that the combination of pembrolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy offers a significant survival advantage to patients with nonsquamous histology (adenocarcinoma) over platinum-based systemic chemotherapy alone, including patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 1% to 49% and less than 1%. KEYNOTE-189 included patients older than age 65, constituting approximately 49% of the study population. The ICI combination group had a slightly higher frequency of grade 3 to 4 adverse events in comparison to the doublet chemotherapy group (67.2%–65.8%, respectively). Different combinations of ICI and doublet chemotherapy were tested based on the tumor histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), and all showed superior outcomes (<span class="s1">Table 91-3</span>). Thus ICI and platinum-based chemotherapy became the standard regimen for treating advanced-stage NSCLC without an actionable mutation, yielding superior survival and clinical outcomes. Contraindications to ICI include autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatic arthritis, connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and interstitial lung disease. For patients with contraindications to ICI, a histology-appropriate systemic chemotherapy may be used.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although data are limited, age is not a contraindication for chemotherapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, the phase III Elderly Lung Cancer Vinorelbine Italian Study (ELVIS) established that single-agent chemotherapy improves survival and quality of life among older adults compared to supportive care alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Subsequent clinical trials demonstrated the superiority of platinum-based chemotherapy versus single-agent chemotherapy among older adults, establishing four to six cycles of doublet platinum-based chemotherapy as the current SOC for fit older adults. Patient selection is key as older adults are more likely to have comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary disease, physiological changes in body composition and drug metabolism, decline in cognitive function, and/or poor PS. Several novel platinum combinations have been studied. Scagliotti et al. demonstrated that a pemetrexed-based regimen has better clinical outcomes in nonsquamous histology NSCLC, making it the first treatment of choice when indicated. On the other hand, a study by Socinski et al., a weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab- paclitaxel) was compared to solvent-bound paclitaxel administered in combination with carboplatin every 3 weeks. In a subgroup analysis of patients aged 70 or older, the overall survival improved in the nab-paclitaxel</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">arm (19.9 vs 10.4 months). The improved clinical outcome with nab- paclitaxel among older adults may be related to better tolerability of the weekly schedule, suggesting that the weekly nab-paclitaxel combination might be the preferred approach in this population. To date, only one trial (Elderly Selection on Geriatric Index Assessment [ESOGIA]) has incorporated a geriatric assessment into treatment decision-making among older patients with stage IV NSCLC (see Geriatric Assessment below).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For second-line therapy or beyond for NSCLC, approved treatment options usually include docetaxel, erlotinib, and, based on histology, pemetrexed and gemcitabine if not already employed as first-line treatment. Ramucirumab, an antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, has been approved in combination with docetaxel based on a phase III trial. However, the combination’s survival advantage over docetaxel monotherapy is relatively small. Based on subset analysis, no survival benefit over docetaxel monotherapy was seen in the few patients aged 70 or older compared to those younger than age 70 (HR 0.96 vs 0.74, respectively). Furthermore, meta-analysis and retrospective studies demonstrated that the addition of angiogenesis to chemotherapy among older adults is associated with more toxicity with no survival benefit. For patients who did not receive immunotherapy in the first-line settings, three ICIs are currently approved for second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC: nivolumab (PD-1), pembrolizumab (PD-1), and atezolizumab (PD-L1). All three ICIs were compared to docetaxel in the second-line settings and showed superior overall survival with better tolerability. Furthermore, second-line or beyond therapy trials specifically in older or functionally vulnerable patients with metastatic NSCLC remain elusive. Goals-of-care discussions including the patient’s and caregivers’ preferences about relative risks and benefits are even more significant at the time of disease progression for metastatic lung cancer.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Maintenance chemotherapy is an evolving treatment strategy for select patients with stage IV NSCLC with a good response to initial platinum-based doublet chemotherapy to delay recurrence. Pemetrexed-based maintenance therapy for patients with adenocarcinoma histology has been shown in several studies to improve progression-free survival and, in at least one major study (PARAMOUNT), demonstrated an overall survival benefit over placebo. In the PARAMOUNT trial, patients older than 70 years comprised 17% of the study population. In a subgroup analysis, this group met the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">primary endpoint and had a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression with maintenance pemetrexed (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.20–0.63) but failed to demonstrate an overall survival advantage. How maintenance chemotherapy strategies versus “drug holidays” should be employed in older and/or frailer patients with NSCLC remains unclear. For those with squamous cell carcinoma, the evidence for gemcitabine- or erlotinib-based maintenance chemotherapy is less robust. In addition, the optimal duration of ICI is not yet determined. Different durations are currently being used for different ICIs, based on the original clinical trial design, ranging from treatment until progression or toxicity versus a fixed duration of 2 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SCLC is less common than NSCLC (&lt; 15% of all lung cancer cases), but is associated with smoking exposure and duration. SCLC has a rapid growth and, unlike NSCLC, patients with SCLC tend to be symptomatic at the time of diagnosis, with common symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, SVC syndrome, hyponatremia/the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), or symptoms related to brain metastases.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the same tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for NSCLC is applied to SCLC, cancer providers frequently still utilize the older clinical staging of limited-stage (LS) (ie, disease that can be confined to a radiation port, ie, up to stage IIIB) versus extensive-stage (ES) disease (ie, stage IVA– B). Because of SCLC’s higher penchant for CNS involvement, all patients with SCLC should undergo brain imaging as part of their initial staging evaluation. SCLC is a chemo- and radiosensitive disease, with high response rates to chemotherapy, which leads to rapid symptomatic relief in first-line therapy. Unfortunately, SCLC has a high rate of recurrence, and it is much more refractory to treatment in the second line. Median overall survival rates associated with treatment for LS- and ES-SCLC range from 12 to 18 months and 8 to 12 months, respectively.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Platinum-based chemotherapy with etoposide is the cornerstone of SCLC treatment. Limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) represents less than a third of SCLC cases. The standard treatment for these patients is concurrent chemoradiation. Early administration of concurrent chemoradiation is associated with a better disease control and survival over a sequential approach but with higher rates of esophagitis and toxicity. Although data in older adults are lacking, different factors such as PS, pulmonary function, and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">comorbidities should be considered in the treatment plan. Based on a large meta-analysis, carboplatin can be incorporated in lieu of cisplatin for older adults or other patients in whom cisplatin may not be well tolerated for either limited- or extensive-stage SCLC.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">ES-SCLC accounts for the majority of cases diagnosed with SCLC. The first treatment strategy to demonstrate an improvement is overall survival in first-line ES-SLCL was the addition of ICI to platinum-based chemotherapy. The IMpower 133 trial demonstrated that the combination of atezolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy followed by maintenance atezolizumab offers a significant survival advantage to patients with ES-SCLC over platinum-based systemic chemotherapy alone, regardless of the PDL1 tumor proportion score, with a median overall survival of 12.3 versus 10.3 months (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54–0.91; <i>p </i>= 0.007). Patients aged 65 or older comprised 46% of the study population, and they showed a significant improvement in overall survival with the addition of atezolizumab (HR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36–0.77). Durvalumab, another ICI, has also been investigated in the first-line settings with platinum-based chemotherapy in the CAPSIAN trial, showing similar results of superior clinical outcomes that were maintained in older adults. Both ICIs are currently FDA-approved in combination with platinum etoposide combination in the first-line settings of ES-SCLC.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Because of the risk of CNS involvement and as a site of relapse in patients with limited- or extensive-stage SCLC, PCI has been evaluated in patients with SCLC who have exhibited a clinical response to initial cancer therapy and remain free of obvious brain metastases. Multiple studies in LS- SCLC have demonstrated its benefit in lowering the risk and time of development of brain metastases, with a recent metanalysis showing a 5.4% 3-year survival benefit. Older adults (ie, 70–80 years) with LS-SCLC may still derive a survival advantage with PCI but are at increased risk of treatment-related adverse events. Any form of WBRT may confer risk of later-term neurocognitive effects, which may particularly be of concern for LS-SCLC patients whose prognosis is generally better than that of those with ES-SCLC. Data for older adults with LS-SCLC who may have subclinical mild cognitive impairment at baseline may be at higher risk for these complications. Hippocampal-sparing radiation therapy planning techniques and the use of neuroprotectants such as memantine have shown some initial promise in patients undergoing WBRT for known brain metastases that may</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">help reduce this risk in patients undergoing PCI in the future. On the contrary, a recent study by Takahashi et al. evaluated the role of PCI in ES-SCLC patients who received brain imaging at baseline and during close surveillance. PCI was associated with detrimental effect on survival, making the role of PCI controversial.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Upon relapse, disease is usually divided into sensitive relapse (&gt; 3 months after completing first-line chemotherapy) or resistant relapse (&lt; 3 months). Platinum-based chemotherapy plus etoposide remains a very good option for sensitive disease. For decades, treatment for refractory disease apart from camptothecins (ie, topotecan, irinotecan) has been limited.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Topotecan is associated with a response rate of 15% to 30% and survival of 4 to 8 months (depending on platinum-sensitivity status to initial treatment) and comes with a very high cost of hematological and nonhematological toxicity. A new major breakthrough is the FDA approval for lurbinectedin in both sensitive and refractory relapse settings based on a single-arm phase II study (<i>N </i>= 105). After a median follow-up of 17.1 months, lurbinectedin had a high response rate of 35.2% with manageable safety profile. Common side effects include hematological toxicity, transaminitis, elevated creatinine, nausea, and fatigue. Although the outcome of older adults was not reported, lurbinectedin can be a reasonable option given its acceptable toxicity profile that can be managed with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis. Patients with platinum-refractory SCLC whose disease progresses on or fails to respond to additional therapy are unlikely to benefit from further therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE ROLE OF PALLIATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE CARE</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative care is gaining acceptance as essential cancer care, particularly for patients with advanced lung cancer. A randomized controlled study evaluated the effect of early palliative care after a new diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC on patient-reported outcomes and end-of-life compared to SOC. Of the 151 patients who underwent randomization, 27 died by 12 weeks and 107 (86% of the remaining patients) completed assessments.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients assigned to early palliative care experienced improved quality of life versus SOC (mean score on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung [FACT-L] scale [in which scores range from 0–136, with higher scores indicating better quality of life] 98.0 vs 91.5; <i>p </i>= 0.03). In addition, fewer patients in the palliative care group than in the SOC group</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">had depressive symptoms (16% vs 38%, <i>p </i>= 0.01). Despite the fact that fewer patients in the early palliative care group received less aggressive end-of-life care (33% vs 54%, <i>p </i>= 0.05), median overall survival was longer (11.6 vs 8.9 months, <i>p </i>= 0.02) compared to SOC.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older adults may have goals or expectations different from those of younger patients, which is particularly relevant in the setting of advanced lung cancer. In a multi-institutional, prospective, observational cohort study that included 710 patients with advanced lung cancer treated with palliative- intent chemotherapy, 69% gave answers that were not consistent with understanding that chemotherapy was very unlikely to cure their cancer.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using multivariable logistic regression, factors that were associated with a greater likelihood of this apparent misunderstanding were non-White race or ethnic group as compared with White race (odds ratio [OR] for Hispanic patients, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.51–5.27; OR for Black patients, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.80–4.78). Educational level, functional status, and the patient’s role in decision-making were not associated with such inaccurate beliefs about chemotherapy. However, there was a strong trend of worse understanding with increasing age (OR 1.68 for patients in the age group 70–79; 95% CI, 1.10–2.59). Thus, goals of chemotherapy need to be conveyed clearly to older adults as there is a high prevalence of misconceptions about the role of chemotherapy. Furthermore, in the above-cited prospective study evaluating the role of early integration of palliative care, participants completed baseline and longitudinal assessments of their perceptions of prognosis and the goals of cancer therapy over a 6-month period. Despite having terminal cancer, a third of patients reported that their cancer was curable at baseline, and a majority (69%) endorsed eradicating the cancer as a goal of therapy. A greater proportion of patients who were assigned to early palliative care in this study developed an accurate assessment of their prognosis over time (83% vs 60%; <i>p </i>= 0.02) compared to SOC. Patients receiving early palliative care who reported an accurate perception of their prognosis were less likely to receive intravenous chemotherapy near the end of life (9.4% vs 50%; <i>p </i>= 0.02). This study has not been replicated with newer treatments such as targeted therapies and immunotherapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Every patient with lung cancer, whether they are receiving treatment or not, should receive full supportive care. Among treatment patients, supportive care includes but is not limited to transfusions of blood and blood</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">products, nutritional support, growth factor support (eg, G-CSF), antibiotics, antiemetics, and antidiarrheal agents.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are the typical nonhematologic adverse side effects of many chemotherapeutic agents; however, antiemetics have significantly improved. Extreme caution and aggressive management is undertaken with both oral and intravenous medications, particularly with the use of cisplatin (highly emetogenic). Prophylactic use of dexamethasone, 5- HT<span class="s11">3</span> antagonists (ondansetron and granisetron), and NK1 receptor antagonists</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(fosaprepitant, IV, or aprepitant, oral) is common. Both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting are more easily prevented and controlled with the use of these combinations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Mucositis and esophagitis are particularly common during receipt of concurrent chemoradiation. Several topical and oral medications are available for use; however, nutritional support becomes of utmost importance, particularly with combined modality use. Anorexia, weight loss, and dysgeusia are also very common, requiring close monitoring of weight and hydration status. Management with a nutritionist/dietician is advised.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fatigue, pain control, and stress also require supportive care. Steroids have been found to be more effective for fatigue than usual care or methylphenidate. Pain control often requires long- and short-acting narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often associated with taxane- containing chemotherapy regimens used in both curative- and palliative- intent regimens. Bisphosphonates are also used for bony metastatic disease. See the Palliative and Supportive Care section of the Cancer and Aging: Genera Principles chapter (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 88</span>) for further information.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Currently in clinical practice, physicians use age, PS, and an overall “gestalt” of how fit an older adult is leading to both under- and overtreatment. Identifying appropriate treatment for a potentially vulnerable patient population is not straightforward in the absence of evidence-based guidelines. Moreover, chronological age does not capture the physiologic and functional status in older adults with advanced lung cancer. There has been a great reliance on ECOG performance status as a measure of physical function in lung cancer clinical trials. However, this test is an</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">oversimplification for the assessment of function in older adults with lung cancer. Comorbidity, polypharmacy, nutrition, cognitive function, and psychosocial factors should be taken into account when caring for older adults with lung cancer. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) would serve as a uniform and reproducible instrument to guide therapy and optimize treatment decisions. The ESOGIA trial is the largest phase III randomized clinical trial using a CGA-directed approach among older adults with stage IV NSCLC. It was a multicenter study comparing older adults (≥ 70 years) with stage IV NSCLC randomized to either a standard strategy of treatment allocation (carboplatin-based doublet chemotherapy or monotherapy with docetaxel) based on PS and age with an experimental strategy allocating the same regimen or best supportive care (BSC) without cancer treatment according to the CGA-directed arm. There was no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatment arms but decreased toxicity and adverse events in the CGA-directed arm. In the United States, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) set a precedent and completed a feasibility study of incorporating CGA into cancer treatment trials. Patients older than age 65 with cancer, who enrolled on cooperative group cancer treatment trials, were eligible to enroll. They completed the CGA tool prior to initiation of protocol therapy, consisting of valid and reliable GA measures, which are primarily self-administered and require minimal resources and time by health care providers. This brief, primarily self-administered CGA large prospective study across several tumor types of over 500 patients using the same CGA process, predicted toxicity of chemotherapy in adults receiving chemotherapy better than MD-rated PS. More recently, randomized clinical trials including all cancer types demonstrate the effectiveness of CGA-directed cancer care and interventions to improve treatment toxicity (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 88</span>). Future studies using a CGA among patients with lung cancer are needed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Aberle DR, Adams AM, Berg CD, et al.

GI cancers are expected to account for 18% of new cancer cases and 28% of cancer-related deaths in the United States in 2020. Both incidence and mortality of GI cancers increase with advancing age (<span class="s1">Figures 92-1</span>, <span class="s1">92-2</span>, and <span class="s1">92-3</span>). Despite overall decreases in incidence of some GI malignancies, older age is associated with higher prevalence of GI malignancies. Many older persons, however, have additional medical conditions, functional limitations, and social isolation that almost certainly contribute to inferior survival and morbidity outcomes. This chapter will explore the epidemiology, presentation, treatment options, and disparities in the care of older persons with GI malignancies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 92-1. <span class="s5">Incidence rates of digestive system cancers by age at diagnosis, 2013 to 2017 (all races, both sexes).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 92-2. <span class="s5">Mortality rates of digestive system cancers by age at death, 2014 to 2018 (all races, both sexes).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 92-3. <span class="s5">Digestive system cancer, SEER 5-year relative survival rates by age group, 2010 to 2016 (all races, both sexes).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In general, the symptoms and presentation of GI cancers in older adults appear similar to those of younger adults. Although treatments for these cancers have been developed primarily in younger adults, greater expertise over time has permitted similarly safe and efficacious therapy to be extended to older age groups. Since the greatest percentage of GI cancers are located in the colon and rectum, most of the information regarding older persons focuses on colorectal cancer (CRC). Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information concerning the treatment of older adults with other GI malignancies.

The US Food and Drug Administration evaluated the proportion of older adults participating in registration trials for new drugs or new indications for existing drugs. Adults older than 65, 70, or 75 represent 36%, 20%, and 9% of those participating in cancer clinical trials compared to 60%, 46%, and 31% of older adults diagnosed with cancer in the United States. Whereas 70% to 75% of CRCs are diagnosed in adults older than 65 years, only 40% to 48% of adults enrolled in National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored or cooperative group trials are drawn from the age group.

The North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) attempted a prospective study in collaboration with Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) (now combined with other clinical trial groups as the alliance) evaluating the benefit of oxaliplatin added to 5-FU/capecitabine and bevacizumab among untreated older adults with metastatic colon cancer (N0949). This study was terminated early due to poor accrual, which may be related to the concern oncologists have about the use of oxaliplatin in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">An unintended consequence of limited efficacy, tolerance, and benefit data, older adults are less likely to be referred for oncology consultation, receive standard therapy or be offered clinical trial. Barriers to clinical trial participation for older adults are multifactorial. The Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) issued a call to action to increase older adult participation in cancer clinical trials. Following a detailed systematic literature review of 11,094 studies discussing system, provider, patient, and caregiver level barriers to and interventions to improve clinical trial participation for older adults, the authors detailed a qualitative evaluation of 13 studies included for final analysis. Key barriers included restrictive eligibility criteria, provider bias, limitations of patient/caregiver knowledge, social determinants of health, and caregiver burden. In a separate qualitative analysis, barriers to clinical trial participation for older adults differed by provider practice setting with academic provider citing physician bias and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">time limitations while community providers acknowledged patient perception and caregiver burden. The authors provide key recommendations for expanding inclusion of older adults in cancer clinical trials. Some of these recommendations are in place in cooperative clinical trial groups, pooled analyses of key studies and secondary analyses of large real-world data sets.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COLORECTAL CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CRC accounts for approximately 8% of all new cancer cases and 9% of all cancer-related deaths in the United States. In fact, CRC causes more deaths than prostate cancer in men 60 to 79 years and falls just short of breast cancer in women 80 years or older. In 2020, 104,610 new cases of colon cancer and 43,340 new cases of rectal cancer will be diagnosed, accounting for approximately 53,200 deaths. Nearly one-third of cases diagnosed occur in adults age 80 or older and 40% of deaths from colon cancer occur in octogenarians. Incidence is decreasing by 4% annually for older adults, largely attributed to recommendations for earlier screening and detection of CRC. The probability of developing CRC increases from 0.4% in the first four decades of life to 3.0% for women and to 3.3% for men in the seventh decade of life (<span class="s1">Figure 92-4</span>). Median age at diagnosis of CRC is 68 years for men and 72 years for women. The overall 5-year relative survival is 64% with this cancer. It is 69% for persons younger than age 65 and declines to 61% for persons older than age 65 (<span class="s1">Figure 92-5</span>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 92-4. <span class="s5">Colon and rectum cancer, SEER incidence rates by age at diagnosis, 2013 to 2017 (both sexes).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 92-5. <span class="s5">Colon and rectum cancer, 5-year relative survival rates by stage at diagnosis, 2010 to 2016 (all races, both sexes).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Studies suggest that older adults present at the time of diagnosis with the same probability of having localized, regionalized, or advanced colon cancer as younger adults. In randomized studies, older adults are reported to have the same performance status and incidence of tumor-related symptoms as younger adults but tend to have more disease-related weight loss. Older adults also appear to have a greater incidence of right-sided (proximal) tumors, and higher rates of obstruction and perforation. This in turn results in a greater likelihood of acute presentations, leading to a higher perioperative mortality rate in this older age group.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While some investigators have noted that overall survival (OS) is shorter in older adults, this difference is not significant if noncancer deaths are excluded. In fact, comorbid illnesses account for a substantial number of deaths among older adults with CRC. In one study of 29,733 adults 67 years and older with localized CRC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)/Medicare database, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes accounted for 9.4%, 5.3%, and 3.9% of deaths, respectively.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk Factors of CRC</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most older adults have no clearly defined risk factors for the development of CRC beyond the process of aging. Hereditary syndromes, such as familial adenomatosis polyposis or hereditary nonpolyposis CRC, have less impact in this older age group, since the majority of hereditary cases are diagnosed before the age of 65. There is one risk factor specific to men who were</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">curatively treated with radiation for localized prostate cancer. These men have a 70% increased risk of developing cancer in previously irradiated portions of the bowel and could potentially benefit from more frequent CRC screening.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemoprevention of CRC</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Various dietary supplements and drugs have been proposed as chemopreventive agents for colorectal neoplasia. Of these, aspirin has been the most widely studied; the regular use of this drug appears to confer a significant risk reduction (relative risk 0.56–0.68). In a study of 536 adults age 70 or older, aspirin use began after colon cancer diagnosis in 20% and was associated with longer OS (adjusted relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.44–0.81, <i>p </i>= 0.001).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In at least two prospective cohort studies, the use of postmenopausal estrogens has been shown to reduce the risk of CRC by approximately 30%. Estrogen supplementation, however, has been associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease, breast cancer, thromboembolic events, and early mortality in at least one large randomized study of postmenopausal women, thereby limiting its use as a chemopreventive agent in older women.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">Additionally, it has been reported that cholesterol-lowering statins can significantly reduce the risk of CRC. As compared to individuals who did not use statins, individuals who used these agents for at least 5 years were able to reduce their relative risk of CRC by one-half.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Screening of CRC</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Approximately, one in two persons will have an adenomatous polyp in their colon by the age of 70. In a Veteran’s Affairs cohort of 17,732 men, prevalence of advanced neoplasia was noted in 13% of those age 70 to 75 compared to 5.7% of men age 50 to 59 undergoing colonoscopy (<i>p </i>&lt; 0.001). Odds of neoplastic transformation from adenoma to invasive carcinoma increases with age by 1.78 per additional decade, with rates of advanced neoplasia and CRC (14.3% and 2.6%, respectively) for adults age 75 or older double that of adults age 50 to 75. Older adults are also more likely to have metachronous advanced neoplasia. The risk of sporadic CRC can be reduced by 50% to 90% if adenomatous polyps are implicated by direct visualization (sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, computed tomography [CT] colonography, or capsule endoscopy) or stool-based testing (FOBT or stool-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">based DNA) and are then removed before they transform into a malignancy over a 5- to 10-year period. Colonoscopy is the most invasive CRC screening option, associated with a 50% reduction in CRC incidence in older adults. The number needed to screen to prevent 1 CRC case in older adults is 126 for men and 98 for women age 75 to 79. Sigmoidoscopy is associated with a 20% reduction in CRC incidence and 35% reduction in CRC death for adults age 70 or older based on the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial of 20,726 older adults. The number needed to screen using sigmoidoscopy to prevent one CRC case is 282. Capsule endoscopy, while less invasive, still requires bowel preparation with secondary risk of electrolyte imbalance and poor prep, and requires colonoscopy if screen is positive. CT colonography also requires bowel preparation and insufflation with risk of bowel perforation. Colonography has sensitivity of 82% to 92% to detect adenomas 1 cm or larger, but still requires colonoscopy for polyps greater than 0.6 cm.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Noninvasive screening modalities risk false positives and ultimate recommendation for colonoscopy to evaluate initial screening finding. FOBT is associated with an 11% to 16% reduction in CRC death with number needed to screen to prevent one CRC-related death of 525 in men and 408 in women age 75 to 79. However, false-positive rates are high with FOBT at 86% to 98%. Randomized trials have demonstrated that routine FOBT can diminish colon cancer mortality by 15% to 20% during an 8- to 18-year follow-up period. While there appears to be a slightly lower mortality benefit to FOBT for older adults (10%–16% compared to 19%–23% for younger adults), this was not observed for immunochemical FOBT such as stool-based DNA testing. In fact, sensitivity of fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) does not differ significantly by age. Sensitivity of FIT to detect CRC or precancerous lesions is higher for stool DNA than FIT (stool DNA: 73.8% or 23.8% vs FIT: 92.3% or 42.4%). Despite better sensitivity, stool DNA testing is not recommended for adults age 85 or older given limited data in that subgroup. Blood testing for methylated septin 9 is not recommended given high false-positive rate with increasing age.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Case-control studies suggest that lower endoscopy and removal of polyps may decrease the incidence and mortality of CRC by 50% to 80%. However, screening extends life to a lesser degree with advancing age. Although colonoscopy appears to be particularly beneficial in older adults who have a higher incidence of proximal neoplasms, which are beyond the view of a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">flexible sigmoidoscopy, the risk of perforation and serious bleeding from colonoscopy is higher than from sigmoidoscopy (3–5 compared to 0.2 per 10,000 procedures and 16 compared to 0.5 per 10,000 procedures, respectively). Older adults are also more likely to have an incomplete colonoscopy, ranging from 78% to 86% for those 70 or older to 52% to 95% for those age 80 or older. While sigmoidoscopy offers lower risk of complications, it should be noted that older adults are more likely to present with proximal tumors, which will be missed on sigmoidoscopy. Prevalence of proximal neoplasia increased from 2% for men age 50 to 59 to 5.9% for those age 70 to 75 in a large Veterans Affairs cohort. This risk increases with advancing age and number of comorbidities. Therefore, screening decisions must be individualized for every older adult.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Guidelines from the American Cancer Society, US Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American Radiological Society suggest the following regarding the screening of average-risk men and women beginning at age 50: flexible sigmoidoscopy to 40 cm or splenic flexure every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, double-contrast barium enema every 5 years, or CT colonography every 5 years. These guidelines also review screening and surveillance for CRC in increased-risk and high-risk persons, with accompanying recommendations. Those at increased risk include those individuals with a personal history of adenomatous polyps or CRC and adults with a family history of colon neoplasia. The US Preventive Services Task Force suggests discussing risk and benefits of CRC screening in adults age 76 to 85 and discontinuing screening for those age 86 or older. However, reduced rates of screening in older adults are likely associated with increased rates of unplanned admissions for colorectal surgery among older adults resulting in longer hospital stays, need for rehabilitation, and less opportunity for preoperative interventions to improve functional outcomes such as prehabilitation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Since only a small percentage of persons at risk for colorectal neoplasia undergo routine screening in the United States, Medicare provides reimbursement for surveillance FOBT (including stool DNA) plus sigmoidoscopy or barium enema or colonoscopy for all beneficiaries. This has increased the prevalence of “screening within 1 year” for FOBT from 20% in persons younger than 65 years to 26% in persons 65 years and older and the prevalence of “endoscopy within 5 years” from 37% in persons younger than 65 years to 48% in persons 65 years or older.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Most older adults have a stated preference to continue CRC screening, feeling that their own life expectancy does not factor into this decision. Since the risk of advanced neoplasia and CRC is highest in older adults, it seems doubtful that screening should be arbitrarily discontinued after a certain age. In the United States, an individual who reaches the age of 80 has an average life expectancy of an additional 10 years for women and 8 years for men. At age 85, average survival is 7 years for women and 6 years for men. This estimate must be adjusted for the number and severity of chronic diseases affecting the individual, as well as his or her functional status. Prognostic tools, such as ePrognosis, incorporate actuarial data along with baseline health, cognition, and comorbid medical conditions. It may be reasonable to discontinue screening when life expectancy is shorter than the time a polyp progresses to a cancer, that is, 5 to 10 years.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Localized CRC</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Surgery—localize d colon cancer </span>Cancers of the colon are typically resected with a hemicolectomy. Whether older age is an adverse prognostic factor in resection of localized colon cancer is controversial. Data on 20,862 adults undergoing surgery in 1997 for colon cancer from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a claims-based database, suggested that perioperative mortality increases gradually with advancing age until the age of 80, after which a substantial increase in mortality is seen (6.9% for adults older than 80 years). Older adults in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1997 had lower mortality rates at high-volume hospitals than at low-volume institutions: 3.1% versus 4.5% for adults older than 65 years (<i>p </i>= 0.03). This effect was even more pronounced for adults older than 80 years, where 4.6% of adults died at high-volume centers compared to 7.3% at smaller institutions (<i>p </i>= 0.04). Therefore, it may be preferable to send the very oldest adults with colon cancer to high-volume hospitals for their resections. Yet a recent study of 24,426 adults (44% age ≥ 75) from the New York State Cancer Registry and the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System showed that older adults tended to have surgery in community hospitals rather than academic medical centers. Older age was associated with higher rate of death at 1-year (2.8% for those &lt; 65, 13.9% for those age</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">≥ 75, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.0001) and postoperative complication (22.6% vs 35.5%, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.0001). Mortality rates in the older age group in this US cohort were like the 11.9% to 14% rates noted in European studies. Following death from</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CRC (45.6%), most frequent cause of death among the 2171 who died was cardiovascular disease (24.5%) and another primary cancer (7.4%).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A tendency to perform less aggressive surgery in older adults may be evident from an analysis of 116,995 adults with localized CRC in the SEER database (1988–2001). This retrospective study revealed that adults 71 years or older were half as likely to receive adequate lymph node evaluation (examination of at least 12 lymph nodes) as younger adults. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that inadequate lymph node evaluation correlates with inferior survival. These data would suggest that less aggressive surgical intervention predisposes older adults to a higher risk of recurrence and cancer-related death.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Increasingly, laparoscopic-assisted colectomies are being performed in the United States and elsewhere. Randomized studies indicate that adults undergoing this procedure have a similar outcome to adults undergoing an “open” colectomy, with slightly less postoperative pain and a 1-day shorter hospital stay. Persons 75 years or older tolerate laparoscopic-assisted colectomy equally as well as younger individuals. One study compared 51 adults ages 70 years or older who underwent laparoscopic colectomy to 102 age-matched adults who underwent open colectomy. Older adults had less overall morbidity with laparoscopic colectomy (17.6%) than with open surgery (37.3%), suggesting that laparoscopic surgery may lessen surgical morbidity for frail, older individuals (<i>p </i>= 0.013).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Surgery—localize d rectal cancer </span>A radical resection with anastomosis or ostomy is the standard surgical procedure for cancers of the rectum. A Veteran’s Administration study of 7243 adults who underwent surgery for their rectal cancer during the period of 1990 to 2000 revealed that 30-day mortality following resection for rectal cancer was 2.1% for adults younger than 65 years compared with 4.9% for adults 65 years or older (<i>p </i>&lt; 0.0001). Five- year survival was 60% versus 48%, respectively (<i>p </i>&lt; 0.0001). French investigators reviewed the records of 92 surgical adults who were 80 years or older and matched these to records of 276 younger adults who underwent resection during the same time interval. Although not statistically significant, older adults had a higher operative mortality than younger adults (8% vs 4%, respectively). Among elective surgeries, the operative mortality was nearly identical (3%–4%). Although 5-year OS was greater for younger adults, 5- year cancer-specific survival was comparable for the two groups.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjuvant the rapy—localize d colon cancer <span class="p">Since the publication of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus statement in 1990, 5-fluorouracil (5- FU)-based adjuvant therapy has represented the standard of care for adults in the United States following the complete resection of colon cancer that has spread to regional lymph nodes (stage III disease). A benefit for postoperative chemotherapy has not been prospectively demonstrated in adults with fully resected, muscle-invasive, lymph node–negative (stage II) colon cancer. However, stage II cancers with high-risk features for recurrence (eg, presentation with obstruction, perforation, or invasion into adjacent organs—stage IIB) are often treated by medical oncologists and are included in many randomized adjuvant trials.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For stage III colon cancer, single-agent 5-FU (with leucovorin [LV]) adjuvant chemotherapy became the standard of care after the publication of multiple studies in the 1990s highlighting its superior survival benefits compared to observation alone. The benefit of adding oxaliplatin to 5-FU/LV was first suggested in the Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5- Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer (MOSAIC) trial, which randomly assigned 2246 adults with resected stage II (40%) or III colon cancer to a 6-month course of 5-FU/LV plus oxaliplatin compared to 5-FU/LV. Adults receiving FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) experienced improved survival. The data are less clear concerning the optimal adjuvant treatment of stage II disease. For adults with stage II tumors with mismatch repair enzyme deficiency (dMMR) or microsatellite instability (MSI-H), an oxaliplatin-based regimen should be considered superior to a fluoropyrimidine-alone regimen.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In 2013, an updated analysis of the Adjuvant CC End Points (ACCENT) database (including seven randomized trials of newer adjuvant chemotherapy, such as MOSAIC, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project [NSABP] C-07, and NO16968) showed no disease-free survival (DFS) or OS benefit among older adults receiving oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. In 2012, Sanoff et al. published an updated SEER- Medicare analysis of receipt and effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy which looked at the differences based on age for colon cancer adults. The data showed trend toward a marginal survival benefit with oxaliplatin use in adults age 75 or older. Another study performed a subpopulation analysis of 315 adults age 70 to 75 enrolled onto the MOSAIC trial. This study demonstrated that age did not alter the impact of treatment on survival</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">outcome. Although the previously observed survival benefit of fluoropyrimidine persisted in the older subgroup, there was no survival advantage with the addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. Additionally, a subgroup analysis of adults 70 years or older from the phase III RCT NSABP C-07 trial showed no benefit to the addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy, despite the risk of added toxicity. There are other studies that also question the use of oxaliplatin in the postoperative setting for older adults, but prospective studies are needed. Until then, the current data need to be considered when planning treatment, and caution taken when considering the addition of oxaliplatin for older adults. Currently, oxaliplatin can be considered for fit adults with minimal comorbidities.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant therapy (IDEA) collaboration evaluated DFS and overall survival of noninferiority of 3 versus 6 months adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of colon cancer. This prospective pooled analysis of six randomized clinical trials (CALGB/SWOG 80702, IDEA France, SCOT, ACHIEVE, TOSCA, and</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HORG) included 12,835 adults from 12 countries diagnosed with stage III colon cancer enrolled from June 2007 through December 2015. Age-specific data have not yet been published. The analysis established similar 5-year overall survival for 3 versus 6 months oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (82.4% vs 82.8%, respectively), establishing noninferiority of short duration therapy. Many oncologists recommend continuing 6-month IV-based FU combined with oxaliplatin for those with T4 or N2 disease. Shorter duration adjuvant therapy is particularly appealing for older adults with potential to reduce toxicity and confirm completion of planned therapy, often curtailed in this subgroup.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Data have shown that the receipt of oxaliplatin is inversely related to advancing age, and older adults are more likely to prematurely discontinue this therapy. The addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine adjuvant therapy in some older adults may also exacerbate underlying comorbidities and unmask frailty. For example, oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy may increase the risk of falls and limit functional status in some older adults with colon cancer. Falls and impaired functional status are both associated with a poorer prognosis in this population.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older adults receive adjuvant chemotherapy less often than their younger counterparts. A retrospective cohort study from 2012 utilized multiple data sets, including the SEER database, to identify 5489 adults 75 years or older</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with resected stage III colon cancer from 2004 to 2007. Overall, over 40% of adults received adjuvant chemotherapy. The likelihood of receiving treatment declined steeply with increasing age. Similar results were noted in an Italian study of 1014 adults with resected stage II/III colon cancer.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The reason for this age-related disparity in management is not entirely clear. In one study utilizing the California Cancer Registry, oncologists cited patient refusal, comorbid illness, or advanced age as the most common reasons for not providing chemotherapy to older adults with resected colon cancer. Financial considerations and logistical problems may also prevent some older adults from seeking care. Additionally, treatment for older adults is more frequently discontinued, suggesting reluctance by physicians to treat older adults who have experienced some degree of side effects to chemotherapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A pooled analysis of 3351 adults in the United States, stratified by decade of life, from seven randomized trials evaluated the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in older persons with stage II or III colon cancer. The primary conclusion of this pooled analysis was that older adults derive the same clinical benefit from postoperative chemotherapy as younger adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment-related toxicity was somewhat higher for older adults, yet not statistically significant. Another US study, however, could not extend this observation to adults 75 years and older, given limitations in the data.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">African-American adults age 65 or older are approximately 44% more likely to die from colon cancer. However, a large cohort study of 1162 adults diagnosed with stage III colon cancer between January 2004 and December 2006 in the SEER-Medicare database (477 receiving oxaliplatin) demonstrated that African-Americans receiving oxaliplatin experienced a greater reduction in CRC mortality compared to Caucasians (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12–0.82 vs adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62–1.09). Reasons</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for improved effectiveness of oxaliplatin in African-Americans is unknown but supports the notion that removal of insurance barriers to access in this Medicare population can lead to improved outcomes for historically undertreated populations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In conclusion, it appears that postoperative chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer is as beneficial in older adults as it is in younger individuals. A slight increase in toxicity should not prevent the clinician from treating these older adults, although increased vigilance during chemotherapy is warranted. Shorter duration of adjuvant therapy is feasible for patients diagnosed with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">stage III cancer; age-related data for those with T4 or N2 disease are pending.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Neoadjuvant/adjuvant the rapy—localize d rectal cancer <span class="p">Chemoradiation before or after surgery reduces the local recurrence rate and increases DFS in adults with deeply invasive (T3–T4) or lymph node–positive rectal cancer. Although there are few data to suggest that older adults respond any differently to chemoradiotherapy than younger adults, they are less frequently referred to oncologists for this treatment. Analysis of the SEER database identified adults 65 years or older with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 1992 and 1996. Increasing age corresponded inversely with the percentage of adults who received adjuvant therapy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overall, chemoradiation therapy was associated with a 17% reduced risk of death among all cases, with a 29% reduced risk of death in stage III adults, but no statistically significant improvement in stage II cases, similar to the results reported in younger adults. More recently, three studies (PROSPECT, PRODIGE23, RAPIDO) examined the role of radiation therapy in perioperative management of localized rectal cancer, age-specific data pending. PROSPECT examined replacement of preoperative chemoradiation therapy with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for those diagnosed with stage II or III rectal cancer; analyses are pending at this time. PRODIGE23 evaluated total neoadjuvant therapy with FOLFIRINOX versus chemoradiation therapy for those diagnosed with T3 or T4 rectal cancer.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disease-free and metastasis-free survival at 3 years was improved in those receiving total neoadjuvant therapy (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.49, 0.97]; HR 0.64</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[95% CI 0.44, 0.93], respectively) with improved pathologic complete response (27.5% vs 11.7%, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001). RAPIDO also evaluated total neoadjuvant therapy, comparing short-course radiation therapy (5 × 5 Gy) compared to chemoradiation therapy (25–28 × 2.0–1.8 Gy), followed by oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy then surgical resection. Disease-related treatment failure a composite endpoint of locoregional failure, disease recurrence, metastasis or death, was the primary outcome. Disease-related treatment failure was improved among the short-course group with reduction in distant metastasis but not locoregional failure. All three studies have potential to reduce toxicity and DFS for subsets of older adults, particularly where overall survival benefit may be limited due to competing risk of death from comorbidities.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Postoperative surveillance —localize d CRC <span class="p">There is general agreement that all</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adults with resected CRC should undergo regular surveillance screening with colonoscopy, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing, and possibly an annual CT scan. Analysis of 52,283 Medicare beneficiaries treated for locoregional CRC between 1986 and 1996 suggested that younger adults are more likely to undergo periodic surveillance endoscopies and that the median time to first follow-up endoscopy is significantly shorter (<i>p </i>&lt; 0.0001) for adults at younger ages.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advanced CRC</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surgery—advanced CRC <span class="p">Removal of the primary cancer is indicated in adults who have an (impending) obstruction, uncontrollable bleeding, or oligometastatic disease that may potentially be cured with aggressive therapy. In spite of these restrictive criteria, a recent pattern of care study, utilizing the SEER database revealed that the majority of adults 65 years or older with stage IV CRC undergo resection of their primary tumor. Overall, 72% of adults underwent this primary cancer–directed surgery. The percentage of adults undergoing surgery declined gradually from 76% in adults 65 to 69 years old to 70% in adults 80 to 84 years old, and then dropped to 62% in adults 85 years or older.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In this pattern of care study, the 30-day mortality was 10% for all adults. However, higher perioperative mortality rates for older adults with advanced CRC have been reported elsewhere. In adults 70 to 79 years, the mortality may be as high as 21% and in octogenarians it may reach 38%. Overall, improvements in surgical technique and postoperative care have led to a decrease in operative mortality particularly in older adults, so that current operative survival figures for older adults now approach those reported for younger adults a decade ago.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older adults with oligometastatic disease or isolated recurrences of their CRC may be candidates for a “curative-intent” resection. In a series from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 128 adults 70 years or older underwent liver resection for metastatic CRC between 1985 and 1994. While these adults experienced a 4% perioperative mortality rate and a 42% complication rate, their median survival was 40 months and 5-year survival rate was 35%. These older adults had a similar outcome to 449 adults less than 70 years old who underwent comparable liver resections during the same time period. In a retrospective analysis of adults age 65 and older in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the SEER database, only 6.1% of the 13,599 adults identified with colorectal metastases limited to the liver underwent hepatic resection. The 30-day mortality rate was 4.3%. Five-year survival for resected adults was superior to those who did not undergo resection (32.8% vs 10.5%; <i>p </i>&lt; 0.0001).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additionally, investigators have reported that appropriately selected older adults can tolerate resection of colorectal lung metastases with similar outcome as younger adults, with acceptable morbidity and mortality.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemothe rapy—advanced CRC</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5-Fluorouracil <span class="p">Until the early 1990s, the only active treatment for advanced CRC was 5-FU, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that this agent, given as a bolus with LV or as an infusion with or without LV, is effective and well tolerated in the older adult population, with similar response rates and overall survival compared to younger cohorts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Folprecht and colleagues carried out a pooled analysis of 22 randomized European trials in which adults received palliative 5-FU-based therapy. In this retrospective analysis, OS (10.8 months for younger adults vs 11.3 months for older adults; <i>p </i>= 0.31) and response rate (20.8% for younger adults vs 17.6% for older adults; <i>p </i>= 0.14) were nearly identical in younger and older adults. Infusional 5-FU proved to be superior to bolus 5-FU in all age groups. Similar results were obtained in a meta-analysis of four large trials of 5-FU-based therapy to examine the efficacy and toxicity of 5-FU in adults 70 years and older (<i>n </i>= 303) compared to younger individuals (<i>n </i>= 1181). While severe neutropenia (40.4% vs 33.6%) and stomatitis (10% vs 4.6%) were significantly increased in older adults, overall response rate (39.5% vs 33.1%) and OS (15.9 vs 15.4 months) were similar to that of younger adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The NCCTG conducted another pooled analysis of 1748 adults with advanced CRC treated with 5-FU-based therapy. No significant differences in response rate (<i>p </i>= 0.90) or OS (<i>p </i>= 0.42) were observed between adults younger than 56 years and older than 70 years. Adults 65 years or older had more overall severe toxicity than their younger counterparts (53% vs 46%; <i>p</i></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">= 0.01). Statistically significant differences in severe diarrhea and stomatitis were reported. Other studies have also noted higher rates of 5-FU-related palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia in older adults.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Capecitabine <span class="p">The oral 5-FU prodrug, capecitabine, has similar efficacy to monthly intravenous 5-FU and LV (Mayo Clinic Regimen) in the metastatic and adjuvant setting. In adults 70 years or older with metastatic CRC, the overall response rate with capecitabine was 24% and the OS time was 11 months. In adults 70 years and older with resected colon cancer, capecitabine offered the same DFS advantage as standard 5-FU and LV. In this adjuvant trial, severe capecitabine-related toxicity was noted in only 12% of adults.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overall, the results with capecitabine in older adults appear similar to those seen in younger individuals.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Irinotecan <span class="p">Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, is another active drug in metastatic CRC. A multi-institutional phase II study found similar rates of severe toxicity in adults 65 years or older and those younger than 65 years receiving a weekly schedule of this agent. In a trial comparing the weekly and the triweekly dosing regimens of this drug as second-line therapy for metastatic disease, more than one-third of 291 adults were at least of 70 years. Age greater than 70 did not affect survival or time to progression but was associated with an increased risk of severe neutropenia and diarrhea compared to adults younger than 70 years.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Various trials have evaluated irinotecan-based chemotherapies in older adults with metastatic CRC. These have included combinations of irinotecan, bolus 5-FU and leucovorin (IFL), irinotecan, infusional 5-FU and leucovorin (FOLFIRI), irinotecan and capecitabine (CAPIRI), and irinotecan and oxaliplatin (IROX). These trials uniformly revealed that response to chemotherapy, median survival times, and degree of toxicity in these older adults appear to be similar to those observed in younger adults.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oxaliplatin <span class="p">Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum analogue, which induces platinum-DNA adducts, inhibiting the replication of DNA. Although it has limited activity as a single agent in CRC, oxaliplatin has notable synergy with 5-FU and LV (FOLFOX). In metastatic CRC, the toxicity following treatment with FOLFOX was evaluated for adults 70 years and older in a pooled analysis of four randomized clinical trials. Although severe hematologic toxicity was increased in older adults, there was no difference in other severe toxicities or 60-day mortality.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For adults with resected colon cancer, a randomized adjuvant trial, in which 35% of adults were 65 years or older, has suggested that DFS can be enhanced if oxaliplatin is added to 5-FU and LV. Subgroup analysis suggested a similar benefit for older adults as for the group as a whole. For those older</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adults with resectable liver metastases, preoperative FOLFOX therapy may be superior to 5-FU therapy. In this study, 2-year OS was prolonged in the FOLFOX group compared to the 5-FU group or to the no chemotherapy group (84% vs 60% vs 23%).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) has been evaluated in 76 adults 70 years and older with metastatic CRC. Overall response was 41%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months, and median OS was 14.4 months with little severe toxicity (3% peripheral neuropathy and 13% palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). A recent randomized study has suggested that the FOLFOX and CAPOX regimens have similar efficacy and rates of toxicity.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The FOCUS2 trial investigated reduced-dose chemotherapy for frail and older adults. A total of 459 adults were randomized to treatment with 5-FU, FOLFOX, capecitabine, or CAPOX all starting at 80% of standard doses with discretionary adjustment as appropriate. Median survival for the groups ranged from 10 to 12 months. The addition of oxaliplatin showed nonsignificant improvement in PFS (5.8 vs 4.5 months). Capecitabine did not improve quality of life compared with 5-FU.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bevacizumab <span class="p">The humanized monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, binds to the vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF), reducing the vascularity of tumors, leading to hypoxia and necrosis. It also appears to lower interstitial fluid pressure in cancer nodules, promoting diffusion of other chemotherapeutic agents into these tumors. Three pivotal studies in adults with advanced CRC have established that this agent consistently enhances the efficacy of 5-FU-based therapy with either irinotecan or oxaliplatin for adults of all age groups. A fourth study compared bolus 5-FU and LV alone or in combination with bevacizumab in adults 65 years and older or in adults of poor performance status. This study demonstrated that bevacizumab could significantly improve survival by 4 months in “suboptimal” adults without significantly increasing toxicity.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Bevacizumab may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis, that is, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial thrombotic event. In multivariate analysis, persons 65 years or older increased their risk of arterial thrombosis from 2.3% with chemotherapy alone to 7.1% with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. This risk increased further to 17.9% if the patient had a history of prior arterial thrombosis. However, progression-free and OS was better for those receiving the bevacizumab combination than for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">those receiving chemotherapy alone. Therefore, bevacizumab was felt to potentially provide a benefit in carefully selected older adults with a history of atherosclerosis-related disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Prospective studies evaluating the clinical benefit of combining bevacizumab with 5-FU or capecitabine as first-line therapy for older adults with metastatic colon cancer have been promising. A phase II study evaluating treatment with 5-FU with or without bevacizumab among adults age older than 65 demonstrated a statistically significant increase in PFS and a nonsignificant improvement in OS. The prospective, randomized phase III Avastin in Elderly With Xeloda (AVEX) study was recently published, comparing capecitabine alone or in combination with bevacizumab. PFS was longer in the combination arm, and a trend was seen toward improved OS. The NCCTG attempted a prospective study evaluating the benefit of oxaliplatin added to 5-FU/capecitabine and bevacizumab among untreated older adults with metastatic colon cancer (N0949). This study was terminated early due to poor accrual, which may be related to the concern oncologists have about the use of oxaliplatin in older adults.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s248">Cetuximab/Panitumumab </span>Cetuximab and panitumumab are monoclonal antibodies to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Blockade of this receptor in CRC cells induces apoptosis and cell death. In individuals with extensively treated metastatic CRC, these agents can induce significant tumor regressions in 8% to 11% of adults; cetuximab in combination with irinotecan has a response rate of 23%. The most common severe toxicities of these agents include dyspnea, asthenia, and an acneiform rash. Cetuximab may also cause a hypersensitivity reaction. In one phase II study of 114 adults 65 years and older with metastatic CRC refractory to irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and 5-FU, cetuximab achieved a response rate of 9.6% compared to a 12.5% response rate in 232 adults younger than 65 years (<i>p </i>&gt; 0.05).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In a randomized trial for adults with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic CRC, panitumumab resulted in partial response rate of 8% and a 46% reduction in risk of tumor progression compared to best supportive care (BSC). Similar to cetuximab, rash is the predominant adverse effect of panitumumab therapy. A severe rash early in the treatment course is predictive of enhanced response and survival with either agent. Based on systematic reviews of the relevant literature, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released a provisional clinical opinion in 2009 stating that all adults with metastatic CRC who are candidates for anti-EGFR</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">antibody therapy should have their tumor tested for KRAS mutations. For adults with metastatic CRC, if KRAS mutation in codon 12 or 13 is found, they should not receive anti-EGFR antibody therapy as part of their treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Cetuximab and bevacizumab along with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI were compared in a phase III Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 80405 trial presented at the 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting. The targeted agents had comparable benefits as first-line treatment with chemotherapy for metastatic CRC, suggesting that the selection of the targeted agent does not impact the outcomes, as long as 5-FU is used, and the biomarkers are appropriately considered. Biomarker data are likely to be increasingly used to help guide treatment decisions for CRC adults. Recent papers, including an analysis of ARCAD data, showed that the distribution of age and the prognostic effect of age did not differ according to KRAS or BRAF mutational status. The data regarding use of biomarkers in routine clinical practice are likely to evolve and further relationships between age and these biomarkers will be explored.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Regorafenib <span class="p">Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of several protein kinases, including kinases involved in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis, oncogenesis, and the tumor microenvironment. In the phase III international CORRECT trial, adults with metastatic CRC who had progressed on previous therapies were randomized to regorafenib or BSC. The adults receiving regorafenib had a median survival of 6.4 months, compared to a 5-month median survival for those who received BSC.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aflibercept <span class="p">Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein containing VEGF- binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors that blocks the activity of VEGF.

Pembrolizumab was associated with a doubling in median time to progression (16 months vs 8 months) and 2-year PFS (48% vs 19%) while reducing incidence of moderate-severe toxicity (grade ≥ 3 adverse event 66% vs 22%) compared to provider’s choice of palliative systemic</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">chemotherapy.

Overall, the probability of 5-year survival for this cancer has historically been under 10%. The median age at presentation is 70 years and thus a significant proportion of patients are older adults. A tissue confirmation of pancreas cancer is established less frequently in older individuals. Thus, a disproportionate number of older patients may be misdiagnosed with this malignancy and may be incorrectly given a poor prognosis to spare them the discomfort of an accurate pathologic diagnosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A study published in 2018 demonstrated that almost 10% of adults harbored inherited genetic variations or mutations that may have increased their susceptibility to the disease. Based on data from this and other studies, many oncologists now offer genetic testing to all adults with pancreatic cancer regardless of age and family history.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Localized Pancreas Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Older patients are more likely than younger patients to present with early- stage pancreas cancer. Surgical resection represents the only potentially curative therapy for this malignancy. Ample evidence suggests that surgical resection can be performed safely in carefully selected older adults. For example, in 206 adults older than 70 years who underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic between 1982 and 1987, operative morbidity and mortality</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rates were 28% and 9%, respectively. Overall median survival was 19 months and 5-year survival were 4%. Similarly, the operative mortality in 138 adults older than 70 years who underwent pancreatic resection at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was 6% and the major complication rate was 45%. These results are virtually identical to those of younger patients. However, the probability of 5-year survival was slightly lower in this group of older adults (21% vs 29%; <i>p </i>= 0.03), possibly because of an enhanced risk from comorbid diseases.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Adults with resected pancreas cancer or locally unresectable pancreas cancer may benefit from chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation therapy. In 2017, the ESPAC-4 trial was published, which compared adjuvant gemcitabine plus capecitabine to gemcitabine alone. With over 700 adults enrolled, the median OS for adults in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group was 28.0 months compared with 25.5 months in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio 0.82, <i>p </i>= 0.032). The average patient age in this study was 65 years, with a range of 37 to 80. In 2018, a study published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine </i>randomly assigned 493 adults with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to receive a modified FOLFIRINOX regimen or gemcitabine for 24 weeks, and demonstrated a median OS was</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">54.4 months in the modified-FOLFIRINOX group and 35.0 months in the gemcitabine group. The age range for adults in this study was 30 to 81 years, with about one-fifth of adults age 70 and older.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has emerged as a potential option for adults with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreas cancer to help enhance long-term outcomes. Studies are underway to investigate the role and efficacy of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/abraxane to try to improve the R0 resection rates and thereby help more patients achieve cure.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Advanced Pancreas Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gemcitabine has typically been considered the standard initial therapy for adults with metastatic pancreas cancer who are not candidates for a more intensive first-line chemotherapy regimen. Adults treated with gemcitabine have a median survival time of 5 to 7 months and a 1-year survival rate of 20%. In the pivotal trial of this agent, median age was 62 years and individuals as old as 79 years of age were enrolled, indicating tolerance of such treatment in older adults. Although the addition of erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, to gemcitabine demonstrated a small survival benefit in younger</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">patients, no such advantage was demonstrated in the 268 adults 65 years or older.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In 2013, a phase III trial (the ACCORD 11 trial) enrolled 342 adults who were chemotherapy-naïve with metastatic pancreatic cancer (10% of adults were age ≥ 75 years). Patients were randomly assigned to gemcitabine alone versus FOLFIRINOX. The response rate was significantly higher with FOLFIRINOX (32% vs 9%). Median PFS (6.4 vs 3.3 months) and OS (11.1 vs 6.8 months) were both better in the FOLFIRINOX arm. A multivariate analysis of this data revealed that age greater than 65 years correlated with worse OS. The side effects of FOLFIRINOX include febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and sensory neuropathy, whereas gemcitabine can cause liver enzyme elevations and rarely hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">An alternative to FOLFIRINOX for metastatic pancreatic cancer would be gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin bound (nab)-paclitaxel. Phase III trial data from 2013 showed significant improvements in nab-paclitaxel- gemcitabine as compared with gemcitabine alone. Median OS was 8.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group as compared with 6.7 months in the gemcitabine. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel- gemcitabine group, as compared with 3.7 months in the gemcitabine group; the response rate was 23% versus 7% in the two groups. Over 40% of the adults in this trial were older than 65 years. The added toxicity of nab- paclitaxel includes peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and cytopenias.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In 2019, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine </i>published the Pancreas Cancer Olaparib Ongoing (POLO) trial, which sought to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with olaparib in adults with a germline BRCA mutation and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that had not progressed during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Following at least 16 weeks of continuous first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer, adults were randomly assigned, in a 3:2 ratio, to receive maintenance olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or placebo. The median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group (7.4 months vs 3.8 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.82; <i>p </i>= 0.004). However, an interim analysis of OS, at a data maturity of 46%, showed no difference between the olaparib and placebo groups (median, 18.9 months vs 18.1 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.46; <i>p </i>= 0.68).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative Care</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pancreatic cancer patients may require treatment of biliary and gastric outlet obstruction, pain, depression, cachexia, and malnutrition. Stents or percutaneous biliary drainage may be necessary to alleviate patients’ symptoms from biliary obstruction. Cachexia, anorexia, and weight loss occur in up to 80% of pancreatic cancer patients and pancreatic insufficiency can contribute to this problem. Microencapsulated lipase supplements can alleviate these symptoms. For pain management, celiac plexus neurolysis may help.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A study published in 2017 evaluated the impact of early integrated palliative care in adults with newly diagnosed lung and GI cancer (mean age of 64.8). The study enrolled 87 adults with pancreatic cancer. In this study, patients who received early palliative care experienced improved quality of life and lower depression at week 24 compared with patients who received usual care alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GASTRIC CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world with nearly 1 million new cases per year accounting for 8% of all cancer cases. The median age at diagnosis is 68. Over 60% of new cases are diagnosed in adults older than age 65 and nearly one-third of gastric cancer patients are age 75 or older. In the United States, the predicted number of new cases for 2020 was 27,600, with 11,010 deaths expected. The results of a German study have suggested that cancers with diffuse histology are more common in younger adults than in adults 70 years or older. In Japan, adults 80 years or older are found to have more advanced disease than younger adults, perhaps because of a later time to diagnosis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Localized Gastric Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gastrectomy is the only curative treatment for gastric cancer. In adults who undergo the resection of all macroscopic and microscopic disease, the long- term survival is approximately 20% to 35% with surgery alone. Addition of perioperative chemotherapy, postoperative chemotherapy, or chemoradiation can further improve survival outcomes. A prospective review of 310 older adults with gastric cancer found that surgery in this group was reasonably well tolerated and led to a survival duration comparable to the results obtained in younger adults. In contrast, a multicenter retrospective study of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1465 adults following surgery for gastric cancer found a statistically significant lower 5-year OS for adults age 70 or older vs adults younger than age 70 (38.9% vs 58.9%, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001) while 5-year cancer-specific survival was comparable. Most, but not all, studies suggest a similar perioperative morbidity and mortality risk for gastrectomy in older and younger adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Japan has the highest proportion of older adults worldwide and a significant number of gastric cancer cases. In a retrospective case control study of 95 adults age 80 or older compared to 366 adults age 60 to 69, there was no statistically significant difference in postoperative complication by age (both groups 23.2%). Type and extent of surgical resection also did not differ by age group with 82.1% of older adults receiving an R0 resection, 69.5% receiving a distal gastrectomy, and 29.5% receiving total gastrectomy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, a lower proportion of older adults received D2 dissection (37.9% vs 50.3%, <i>p </i>= 0.03). While length of hospital stay did not differ, older adults were twice as likely to require rehabilitation stay following hospital discharge despite no statistical difference in postoperative complications.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still, older adults were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (9.5% vs 29%, <i>p </i>= 0.05), in part due to increased number of comorbid medical conditions in the older age group (proportion with at least one comorbid medical condition 74.7% vs 49.5%, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.05). Older adults with stage II or III disease experience lower 5-year OS compared to younger adults (II: 17% vs 83%; III: 28% vs 54%), although survival was similar among older adults regardless of receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A British multicenter prospective cohort study showed that surgical morbidity and mortality did not differ significantly by age. Of the 955 adults who underwent esophagectomy or gastrectomy, morbidity for adults younger than 70 years and older than 70 years was 50% and 48%, respectively.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mortality was also similar at 10% and 14%, respectively, for those two age groups. In Italy, age was found to be an independent predictor of recurrence in 536 adults following gastric cancer resection. It appears that short-term benefit from surgical resection is feasible for older adults; however, options for postoperative therapy are key to sustained benefit.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The CRITICS trial evaluated 788 adults (172 [22%] age 70 or older) randomized to perioperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemotherapy with postoperative chemoradiation therapy. In an unplanned posthoc analysis by age, chemotherapy grade 3 to 5 toxicity was greater in older adults (77% vs 62%, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001) and older adults were less likely to complete planned</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">preoperative therapy despite 10% lower dose intensity for epirubicin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine compared to younger adults. While most adults proceeded to curative surgery regardless of age (80% older adults vs 81% younger adults, <i>p </i>= 0.74), fewer older adults went on to receive planned postoperative therapy (64% vs 78%, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001). Again, older adults receiving postoperative chemotherapy did so at a significantly lower dose intensity than younger adults, in some cases 20% lower dosing and fewer older adults completed planned postoperative therapy (68% vs 79%) despite similar grade 3 to 5 toxicities. For the subset randomized to postoperative chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy dosing, toxicity, and completion rates were similar. Despite differences in treatment receipt and dose intensity, 2-year OS and event-free survival (EFS) were similar regardless of age (2-year OS: 59% vs 61%; 2-year EFS: 53% vs 51%). In a randomized controlled trial of perioperative chemotherapy for resectable esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric cancers, two cycles of combination chemotherapy administered before and after surgical resection provided a 4-month improvement in median survival compared with surgical resection alone. In another study of 556 adults with resected gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, individuals who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy had a 9-month increase in OS compared to those who underwent surgery alone. It is currently uncertain which one of these two approaches is better tolerated and offers a superior survival advantage.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although prospective data specific to older adults are not currently available, the unplanned posthoc analysis by age from the CRITICS and other trials suggests that adults with localized gastric cancer be considered for perioperative chemotherapy or postoperative chemoradiation.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Advanced Gastric Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The efficacy of chemotherapy programs for gastric cancer has not been specifically analyzed by age. Single-agent therapy generally results in less toxicity than is observed with platinum-based combinations and may be better suited for older individuals. Platinum analogues must be carefully dosed, since renal platinum clearance declines with increasing age. Single agents commonly used in gastric cancer include 5-FU, capecitabine, the taxanes, and irinotecan. Trials including combinations of 5-FU, LV, and oxaliplatin, capecitabine and oxaliplatin, irinotecan and cisplatin (IC), and 5-FU, LV, and irinotecan have included adults 65 years or older. However,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">subgroup analyses evaluating response and toxicity in these older adults have not been performed. However, two pooled analyses provide some insight into treatment response among older adults. Pooled analysis of three United Kingdom studies of advanced esophagogastric cancer in 257 adults age 70 or older (160 age 70–74, 78 age 75–74, 19 age 80 or older) compared to 823 adults younger than 70. Age was not predictive of survival, overall response rate, OS, or risk of severe toxicity. Pooled analysis of eight North Central Cancer Treatment Group trials evaluating treatment tolerance for 154 older adults age 65 or older compared to 213 younger adults diagnosed with esophagogastric cancer demonstrated comparable OS and PFS outcomes despite higher frequency of severe toxicities among older adults (73% vs 66%, <i>p </i>= 0.02). Small, single-institution trials have shown a benefit for combination therapy in selected, fit older adults. One such study of cisplatin, LV, and FU in 58 adults 65 years and older with metastatic gastric cancer noted significant responses in 43% of adults. Investigators noted that the therapy was well tolerated. Another study comparing epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (ECF), IC, and FOLFOX found that ECF and FOLFOX both had similar response rates and OS (better than IC), but that FOLFOX was less toxic. More recently, FLOT was shown to improve overall response rate and PFS in younger adults but not those with metastatic disease or older than age 70. Further FLOT was associated with increased severe toxicity and inferior quality of life across all groups suggesting older adults are unlikely to benefit from this regimen. Given the paucity of data about the older adults in studies of gastric cancer, this may represent an appropriate time to weigh the toxicities of the chemotherapy regimens when selecting the treatment of older adults with gastric cancer.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 <span class="p">Human EGFR 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), a member of a family of receptors associated with tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, and differentiation, is a biomarker in gastric cancer showing amplification or overexpression in 7% to 34% of tumors. In 2010, the phase III ToGA trial demonstrated that trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against HER2, in addition to chemotherapy benefits adults with gastric cancer (median survival of 13.8 months in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared to 11.1 months to the control group).</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ramucirumab <span class="p">Published in 2014, the phase III REGARD trial demonstrated significant improvements in OS (5.2 vs 3.8 months) in adults receiving</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ramucirumab, a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) receptor targeted antibody. In this trial, 36% of the adults were older than age 65.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ramucirumab resulted in similar improvements for OS and PFS between adults younger than 65 years and those age 65 and older. Adverse effect profiles were also similar between age groups.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Results were released from the RAINBOW trial in 2014, an international phase III, randomized, double-blind study of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic gastroesophageal junction and gastric adenocarcinoma following disease progression on first-line platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-containing combination therapy. The authors found a statistically significant and clinically meaningful OS benefit of more than 2 months for the adults treated with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel. There is currently no documented data regarding the outcomes of the older adults from this trial.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PRIMARY LIVER CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primary liver cancer—hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)—is the second most common cause of cancer death in the world, leading to over half a million deaths annually. In contrast, the annual incidence in the United States has been relatively low, with 42,810 new cases and 30,160 deaths expected in 2020. In the United States, the incidence of HCC levels is higher among Blacks than Whites (10.9 vs 6.9 per 100,000 population) as is mortality (13.5 vs 8.4 for men; 4.9 vs 3.5 per 100,000 population for women). Incidence of HCC has increased for older adults by 8% for those age 65 to 69 years and 3% for those age 70 or older. The risk factors for primary liver cancer are potentially related to aging including comorbid medical conditions, fatty liver disease, and acquired hepatitis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Primary Liver Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment options for older adults with HCC restricted to the liver include liver resection, liver transplant, nonsurgical tumor ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, selective internal radiation therapy, or stereotactic body radiotherapy. Surgery and chemoembolization in the geriatric population have been found to be tolerable in some but not all experiences. Older adults are more likely to receive ablative therapy than resection or chemoradiation</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">therapy. In a review of the 2696 Medicare adults with HCC between 1992 and 1999, 13% had procedures with curative intent (0.9% transplant, 8.2% resection, 4.1% local ablation), 4% underwent transarterial chemoembolization, 57% received palliative therapy, and 26% did not get treatment. Only 34% of adults with solitary lesions or lesions less than 3 cm in diameter received therapy with curative intent, suggesting underutilization of curative interventions in eligible older adults. Three-year survival for transarterial chemoembolization or local ablation was less than 10%. While recurrence-free survival appeared similar with surgery versus radiofrequency ablation among older adults participating in the SURF study, the cohort was limited to those younger than age 80. Similarly, transarterial chemoembolization increased survival at 1 and 3 years following procedure with similar 5-year survival and rate of complication for adults age 75 or older compared to younger adults. Considering life expectancy of older adults diagnosed with HCC and risk of morbidity following surgical resection, an ablative or embolization approach is reasonable for older adults as an alternative to resection.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In a retrospective, multicenter study by the Italian Liver Cancer Group evaluating a 20-year cohort of 614 older adults age 70 or older and 1104 younger adults, survival outcomes for older adults appeared like that of younger adults following surgical resection (52 months vs 47 months, respectively). Surgical resection of liver tumors is well tolerated in older adults. In a European study, cirrhotic adults with HCC older than 70 years were compared to adults younger than 70. The operative morbidity and liver failure rates were lower in the subset of older adults (23.4% vs 42.4% and 1.6% vs 12.9%, respectively). Operative mortality and 5-year survival rates were not significantly different between the two groups. In a smaller study of less than 300 patients, older adults were observed to have higher frailty based on a modified Frailty Index, higher mortality rates (8% vs 2%, <i>p </i>= 0.011) but similar overall and DFS at 5 years compared to younger adults (5- year OS 62% vs 68.5%, DFS 30.4% vs 38.8%, respectively). One measure of frailty, G8, was independently predictive of postoperative complications among older adults suggesting that geriatric assessment, among other preoperative factors such as comorbid medical conditions, nutritional status, and cognition, can help select older adults for surgical resection.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While few transplants are offered to older adults (3.1% in the United States in 2014), studies suggest that older adults with preserved synthetic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">function experience similar survival benefit and graft loss rates to younger adults following liver transplantation. The use of cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown modest benefits for adults with HCC, and the durations of these benefits are commonly short. No single regimen has proven superior to any other. Molecularly targeted agents, particularly sorafenib, offer the potential for improved survival for advanced HCC. The phase III multicenter European SHARP trial randomly assigned 602 adults with inoperable HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis to sorafenib versus placebo. OS was significantly longer in the sorafenib-treated adults (10.7 vs 7.9 months), as was time to radiologic progression (5.5 vs 2.8 months). The average age for adults on this trial was approximately 65.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Systemic therapy options for treatment of HCC have increased to include first- and second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as immunotherapy; however, few prospective studies included specific analyses regarding older adults, frailty, and/or comorbid medical conditions. Retrospective analysis of sorafenib following approval from the SHARP study demonstrates similar survival outcomes for older adults. The REFLECT study of lenvatinib demonstrated similar survival among the 43% of participants age 65 or older compared to younger adults. Hand-foot syndrome appears higher for older adults prescribed sorafenib versus higher rates of hypertension for those receiving lenvatinib. Second-line therapy for HCC now includes regorafenib for those for whom sorafenib is no longer effective based on the RESORCE study. Cabozantinib also appears to have a similar overall and PFS benefit regardless of age. Lastly, the REACH-2 study demonstrated OS benefit of ramucirumab, although age-specific data have not yet been published. Thus far, age-specific data are not available for checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab or pembrolizumab, both demonstrating a survival benefit following sorafenib for treatment of HCC. Optimal treatment for HCC in older adults should include consideration of potential toxicities, ability to consistently take oral medications, and possible interaction with other medications or comorbid conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ESOPHAGEAL CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus are the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In the United States, esophageal cancer is less common, with 18,440 new cases and 16,170 deaths anticipated in 2020. Median age of diagnosis is 68 with 41% of cases</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">occurring in adults age 75 or older. Highest incidence rates occur in men age 85 to 89 and women age 90 or older. Between 1974 and 1994, the appearance of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus increased substantially, particularly in White men between 65 and 74 years, while the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas declined slightly. The epidemiologic pattern of esophageal carcinoma does not appear different in older adults. Most studies report similar clinical symptoms at the time of presentation, as well as similar distribution of histology, stage, and location of tumors for adults older and younger than 70 years. In these series, approximately 50% to 75% of the older adults were found to have adenocarcinoma and 25% to 50% had squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It is unclear if the incidence of Barrett-associated adenocarcinoma increases with advanced age. Although one study has suggested a higher incidence in older adults, another study suggested this incidence is not age- dependent. The location of tumors in the esophagus does not differ between older and younger adults—distal esophageal tumors predominate in all groups. A similar distribution in early- and late-stage cancers has also been reported.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Localized Esophageal Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At this time, there is no prospective study evaluating outcome of preoperative chemoradiation therapy followed by esophagectomy for older adults. Extrapolating from subgroup and retrospective analyses, most, but not all studies suggest that age is not a limiting factor in surgery of the esophagus. Although older adults tend to have a higher incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular complications than younger adults, this does not appear to have a significant effect on operative mortality or survival. In one study, 50 adults older than 70 years were compared to 89 adults younger than 70 years; postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality occurred in 38% and 3% of younger adults and in 44% and 0% of older adults. The mean duration of hospitalization was 17.9 days for younger adults and 18.6 days for older adults. The severity of postoperative dysphagia and weight loss was similar for both groups. The likelihood of survival after 8 years was identical at 20%.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In a second study of 60 adults 70 years and older, no difference was observed in the rate of resection with curative intent, surgical complications, or hospital mortality rate in comparison to a younger population. This was</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">confirmed in another study, demonstrating equivalent surgical morbidity and mortality for older adults stratified by performance status and overall fitness in comparison to younger adults. A contradictory study suggested that age was predictive of morbidity and mortality following esophagectomy in multivariate analysis (<i>p </i>= 0.002). Age and comorbidity were also noted to be significant predictors of outcome in a simple risk score developed to predict surgical mortality for esophageal cancer.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although the rate of surgical complications may not be significantly increased in older adults, the presence of such complications significantly worsens survival. This was the conclusion in a review of 510 adults who underwent resection of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1996 to 2001. Surgical complications occurred in 31.8% of the 173 adults 65 to 74 years and in 34.8% of the 66 adults 75 years and older. Although survival at 30 days did not differ significantly between patient groups who did and did not experience surgical complications, there was a notable decline in 1-year survival for adults 65 years and older who had suffered a perioperative complication. In a separate study at the same institution, octogenarians were noted to have more than a threefold higher mortality rate than adults 50 to 79 years, although they experienced similar rates of operative complications (blood loss, cardiopulmonary complications, infection, and anastomotic leak).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A review of 945 adults in the Veterans Administration National Surgical Quality Improvement Program found no difference in 30-day surgical mortality and morbidity between transthoracic and transhiatal esophagectomies. Age did significantly impact the overall mortality rate for both surgical techniques, with increasing age associated with an increased risk of surgical mortality. The same age-related surgical mortality risk was also noted in a French study of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although age may not be a significant factor in the rate of curative resection, curative surgery is still underutilized in older racial minority adults. African-American adults 65 years and older were noted to have a lower rate of surgical consultation and half the rate of curative surgery as their older adult Caucasian counterparts (70% vs 78%; <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001 and 25%</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">vs 46%; <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001, respectively).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Chemoradiation therapy appears equally effective in adults 70 years and older as in younger individuals. Furthermore, there appears to be no</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">association between age and toxicity in adults of good performance status. At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 24 older adults (median age 77) with locally advanced esophageal cancer were treated with 5040 cGy of radiation and infusional 5-FU plus mitomycin C over a 6-week period. Nine of these individuals (38%) required hospitalization for toxicity and three required dose reductions. Sixteen adults achieved a clinical remission and 10 remained without evidence of disease after a median follow-up of 1.2 years, suggesting that selected chemoradiation therapy is a feasible and well- tolerated alternative to esophagectomy in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The CROSS trial, published in 2012, compared surgery alone to neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel and concurrent radiotherapy followed by surgery. The chemoradiotherapy group had higher rates of complete resection (92% vs 69%) and OS (49.4 vs 24 months). The median age of adults in this trial was 60. Subsequent analysis using the National Cancer Database evaluated 4099 older adults age 76 or older who would have been excluded from the CROSS trial based on age. Most older adults underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy (73%) while 14% received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery and 12% underwent surgery alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Median OS was highest for those receiving trimodality therapy (26.7 months) compared to 20.3 months for surgery alone and 17.8 months for definitive chemoradiotherapy (<i>p </i>&lt; 0.05). Attempting to control for selection bias, propensity matching demonstrated a trend toward improved OS, lower hospital 30-day readmission, and improved 30- and 90-day mortality with trimodality therapy compared to surgery alone (<i>p </i>= 0.08); OS of definitive chemoradiotherapy was comparable to surgery alone (<i>p </i>= 0.67).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Recognizing the predictive value of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as markers of systemic inflammation, frailty, disability, and poor outcomes in other cancer, Jain et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of PLR and NLR for 125 adults (<i>n </i>= 67 age ≥ 65) receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy at a single academic medical center from 2002 through 2014. While older age was not associated with significant differences in treatment-related toxicity, relapse-free survival, OS, or pretreatment PLR in multivariate analysis, older age was associated with high pretreatment NLR (<i>p </i>= 0.01), which in turn was associated with reduced relapse-free survival (<i>p </i>= 0.002). Neither NLR nor PLR was associated with toxicity or OS.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Advanced Esophageal Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Single agents, such as the taxanes, irinotecan, 5-FU, capecitabine, and vinorelbine, have some efficacy in palliating metastatic esophageal cancer and represent management options for older adults, particularly for those with lower performance status or significant comorbidities. Combination chemotherapy regimens tend to have more side effects and have not been systematically evaluated in older adults with esophageal cancer. Preliminary results of one study in adults 70 years or older suggested that the combination of weekly docetaxel and infusional 5-FU is well tolerated in this age group.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Toxicities were primarily neutropenia and mucositis. The advances in gastric cancer frequently apply to the esophageal population; thus, the promising results from the REGARD trial and the RAINBOW trial discussed in gastric cancer may also extend to this population.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BILIARY TRACT CANCERS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cancers of the biliary tract (gallbladder, cholangiocarcinoma) occur infrequently in the United States. The incidence increases with age and reaches its peak in the seventh decade of life. Yearly, under 5000 new cases of gallbladder cancer and under 12,000 new cases of cholangiocarcinoma are diagnosed in the United States. The presentation and clinical features of this cancer do not appear to differ appreciably between older and younger adults. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is often used in the diagnosis of biliary tract cancers and is well tolerated in older adults—even the very old. In a study of 126 adults 90 years and older who underwent a total of 147 ERCP procedures, 9.5% were noted to have malignant stenosis. The overall morbidity and mortality rates were low at 2.5% and 0.7%, respectively.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Biliary Tract Cancers</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment for this disease. A retrospective single institution study from Japan reviewed the cases of 54 adults who were 75 years or older and compared them to 152 adults less than 75 years. Approximately 58% of adults in both age groups underwent a radical resection (rather than a simple cholecystectomy). Operative mortality and survival rates were similar between the two age groups. The investigators noted that the likelihood of 5-year survival was better for those older adults who had undergone a radical resection, compared to those who</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">had undergone a simple cholecystectomy (61% vs 14%; <i>p </i>= 0.0098). These uncontrolled results have not been validated through a randomized trial. For adults with localized disease who undergo surgical resection, adjuvant therapy for all adults following resection is often recommended. Options for adjuvant treatment in bile duct cancer include capecitabine for 6 months, or four cycles of capecitabine plus gemcitabine followed by concurrent radiation plus oral capecitabine, as was used in Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S0809, or 6 months of single-agent LV-modulated FU. Notably, clinical trials in biliary tract cancers have not been age-specific nor always included age subgroup analysis. However, secondary analyses of trials and retrospective data suggest equivalent survival benefit, regardless of patient age.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although advanced biliary tract cancer is highly resistant to chemotherapy, single agents such as gemcitabine, 5-FU, and capecitabine are generally well tolerated in older adults and may offer some palliation in this disease. Trial data to date suggest that gemcitabine and gemcitabine-based platinum regimens offer a slight advantage over other regimens for gallbladder cancer. Studies have shown that adding fluoropyrimidines, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan to gemcitabine can yield similar results, but the toxicity and tolerability data tend to favor gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combinations. Thus, while several combinations have been tried, single agents appear to be better for older adults. In a small study of advanced biliary tract cancers and gallbladder cancer treated with the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, no difference in response rate was noted between 10 adults 60 years and older and 30 younger adults, although the older adults had higher rates of hematologic toxicity.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Recently, growing evidence supports the use of targeted agents in biliary tract cancers. For example, studies in adults with previously treated advanced cholangiocarcinoma whose tumors harbor fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene rearrangements/fusions or an isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation demonstrate promise for agents specifically targeting these alterations: pemigatinib (FIGHT-202 trial) and ivosidenib (ClarIDHy phase 3 trial), respectively. Although not specifically tested in older adults, analyses across different age groups for the FGFR agent seemed to suggest similar benefits for older and younger patients.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANAL CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal is one of the least common but most treatable of the GI malignancies. Anal cancer represents only 2.7% of all GI malignancies in the United States, with under 10,000 new cases diagnosed annually. The risk factors for anal cancer and genital malignancies are similar. Increased risk of anal cancer has been associated with female gender, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), lifetime number of sexual partners, genital warts, cigarette smoking, receptive anal intercourse, infection with HIV, and other causes of chronic immunosuppression. The risk of HPV-related anal cancer increases with age. Older age at first receptive intercourse was associated with increased prevalence of both low- and high- grade squamous dysplasia, the precursor lesions to anal cancer. The higher incidence of anal cancer is more pronounced in adults 65 years and older than in younger age groups. Five-year survival does not differ significantly by gender or age.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment—Anal Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since the 1970s, the standard treatment for localized anal cancer has been the combination of 5-FU, mitomycin, and radiation therapy. With this technique, 60% to 73% of adults will remain free of disease recurrence and a colostomy at 4 years. Age has not been associated with either tumor-related or therapy-related rates of colostomy. A small study evaluating this nonsurgical strategy in adults 75 years or older demonstrated similar complication rates to those seen in younger adults, suggesting that sphincter- conserving treatment is feasible in older adults with anal carcinoma. In an Australian study of 62 adults, treated with chemoradiation (mitomycin C and 5-FU) and anal sphincter preservation surgery, the local control rate was 86% and the colostomy-free survival at 2 years was 83%. This study included 38 adults 60 years and older.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Radiation used in the treatment of anal cancer in women 65 years or older can lead to a threefold increased risk of pelvic fracture. These women are at greater risk for fracture than women treated with radiation therapy for cervical or rectal cancer. Therefore, older women treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for anal cancer should undergo regular bone densitometry screening and bisphosphonate therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Systemic therapy represents the standard approach for treatment of advanced, metastatic anal cancer. The regimen of cisplatin plus FU represents the most widely published active regimen for the treatment of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">advanced anal cancer. Recent evidence from the InterAACT trial demonstrated the efficacy of paclitaxel plus carboplatin for anal cancer, although the maximum patient age in this study was 75 years, and we lack subgroup analyses by age for this regimen.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Notably, for adults with advanced anal cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the PD-1 pathway, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, may represent viable options. Currently, limited data exist about the safety and efficacy of these agents for older adults with anal cancer.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS)</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next-generation sequencing (NGS), a form of DNA sequencing technology that uses parallel sequencing of multiple fragments of DNA to determine sequence, provides a “high-throughput” method for increasing the speed of sequencing an individual’s genome. NGS can be used to sequence a patient’s entire genome or smaller portions of the genome. In GI cancer, NGS gene panels can be used clinically to guide screening, preventive options, and cancer treatment, including the use of a cancer gene panel that includes <i>BRCA1 </i>and <i>BRCA2 </i>if there is a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer, even in the absence of breast or ovarian cancer. Additionally, in CRC, screening for inherited causes may consider the use of NGS panels that include <i>APC, BMPR1A, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, PMS2, PTEN, SMAD4, STK11, TP53, BLM, CHEK2, GALNT12, GREM1, POLD1</i>,</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and/or <i>POLE</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Importantly, NGS can provide both predictive and prognostic information for adults with cancer. Specifically, NGS could help identify possible targets for therapies, which could potentially represent less toxic and more effective options for older adults with cancer. Additionally, NGS can help to identify markers with prognostic significance. For example, microsatellite instability high status often correlates with better survival, while <i>BRAF </i>mutations correlate with worse survival outcomes, regardless of patient age. Recently, growing evidence supports the use of noninvasive genomic profiling of tumors with NGS from blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Collectively, NGS can help as a strategy to guide treatment discussions for older adults with cancer, yet NGS-enabled precision oncology can add complexity to clinical decision-making and additional work is needed to understand the optimal tissue on which to perform NGS (primary tumor or metastasis, tumor DNA or circulating tumor DNA, etc) and the optimal</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">timing for when to obtain NGS (at initial diagnosis, following a predefined amount of therapy, or when the disease is refractory).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">McCleary NJ, Hubbard J, Mahoney MR, et al.

Despite these staggering numbers, statistics on the incidence and prevalence of skin cancer are thought to be underestimated since many cancer registries do not collect data on all types of cutaneous carcinomas. As with most cancers, skin cancer places a disproportionate burden on older adults, particularly since skin photoaging from cumulative ultraviolet (UV) exposure is a major risk factor. One in five Caucasian Americans develops skin cancer by age 70, and the incidence of cutaneous carcinoma has been rising in older adults, exemplified by a 100% increase in the incidence of skin cancer from 1992 to 2012 in data from Medicare fee-for-service patients. As incidence rises, so too do associated costs. From 2002 to 2006, skin cancer treatment costed $3.6 billion, and from 2007 to 2011, this rose by 126% to $8.1 billion.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There are three main types of cutaneous carcinomas: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. Collectively, BCCs and SCCs are referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancer or keratinocyte carcinomas. BCCs are the most common form of skin cancer (79% of skin cancers), followed by SCCs (14%), melanoma (5%), and then other forms of cutaneous carcinoma. Despite accounting for only 5% of skin cancer diagnoses, melanoma is responsible for a significant proportion of skin cancer–related deaths; 2018 global data from the World Health Organization estimated 65,155 deaths from keratinocyte carcinomas and 60,172 deaths from melanoma. In the United States, it is estimated that one</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">person dies from melanoma every hour. While BCCs and SCCs are typically less lethal, they are instead associated with significant morbidity. Given skin cancer’s increasing prevalence, cost to the healthcare system, and morbidity and mortality, it is important for providers to understand this disease, and with its predilection for older adults, it is especially important for geriatricians to not only have a working knowledge of skin cancer, but also of the special considerations that come with diagnosing and treating cutaneous carcinoma in this population.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><ul id="l9"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">To recognize different types of skin cancer including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">To understand available treatment modalities for different types of skin cancer.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">To determine when referral to a dermatology specialist is indicated.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><div class="textbox" style="border:1.5pt solid #D46B38;display:block;min-height:303.0pt;width:456.0pt;"><p class="s249" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><ol id="l10"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Skin cancers are common in older adults, and the vast majority of skin cancers in this population are BCCs and SCCs.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Malignant melanoma and MCC are more aggressive than BCCs and SCCs and carry a higher risk of lymph node and distal metastasis.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Overall, definitive treatment of skin cancers is well tolerated by older adults.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">When determining appropriate treatment for skin cancers in older adults, it is important to discuss the risks versus benefits of the various treatment modalities available, while assessing the mortality and morbidity risk of the lesion in the context of the patient’s goals for treatment.</p></li></ol></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ETIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The major underlying risk factor across all forms of skin cancer is cumulative exposure to UV radiation including sunlight, artificial tanning devices (tanning booths), and sunburns. Blistering sunburns, in particular, have a strong association with skin cancer. Caucasian women with at least five blistering sunburns between ages 15 and 20 have been found to have a 68% increased risk for keratinocyte carcinoma and an 80% increased risk for melanoma. This increased risk, however, is not just limited to adolescent or childhood sunburn history; it is found with adult and cumulative lifetime sunburns as well. Skin cancer is therefore more predominant in older adults whose age lends to greater cumulative UV exposure compared to younger patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">UV radiation is part of the electromagnetic radiation that is released by the sun. It is subclassified by wavelength, with UVC ranging from 200 to 280 nm, UVB from 290 to 320 nm, and UVA from 320 to 400 nm. A majority of UVC is blocked by the ozone layer, but both UVA and UVB reach the Earth’s surface in significant amounts and are absorbed by the skin. UVB is responsible for much of the actinic skin damage, erythema, and sunburns caused by sunlight. On the other hand, the longer wavelengths of UVA penetrate deeper into the skin, and while it has a reduced risk of sunburn compared to UVB, UVA still contributes to photoaging and cutaneous carcinogenesis. UV radiation induces skin cancer via a variety of mechanisms, including direct DNA damage, damage to DNA repair systems, and alteration of the local cutaneous immune system. Cumulative UV exposure will therefore be greatest in patients whose occupational and recreational activities (eg, farming, sailing) lead them to spend more time in the sun. Geographic location can also play a role in increased UV exposure. UV at the Earth’s surface is affected by the number of atmospheric particles it must pass through, and therefore it is highest in areas which are more directly hit by the sun, including the equator and higher altitudes. Lastly, while many patients’ UV exposure is obtained from spending time outdoors, indoor tanning beds are also significant sources of UV radiation. Studies show that UV output in these salons can be up to 10 times more potent than sunlight.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When assessing risk for skin cancer, it is therefore important to ask patients about their prior occupations, recreational activities, and history of tanning bed use. Screening questions for these risk factors are summarized in <span class="s1">Table 93-1</span>, with additional discussion of unique risk factors for each cutaneous carcinoma under its appropriate sections.</p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 93-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>SCREENING QUESTIONS TO ASSESS RISK FOR SKIN CANCER</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Not every patient with the same history of UV exposure has an equal risk of developing skin cancer. The risk is greatest in patients who are most sensitive to UV radiation, that is, light-skinned individuals with blue or green eyes and red, blonde, or light brown hair. Light-colored skin is more likely to burn than tan on UV exposure, and as epidermal melanin increases, individuals instead tend to tan and are less likely to burn. This association between UV sensitivity and skin pigmentation is illustrated by the Fitzpatrick Phototyping Scale, which categorizes skin into six phototypes, with each successive type having increased UV resistance and epidermal melanin.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Individuals with darker skin tones therefore have reduced skin cancer risk compared to those with lighter skin. For example, in the case of melanoma, while non-Hispanic Whites have an annual incidence rate of 28 cases of melanoma per 100,000 individuals, and this decreases to 5 per 100,000 for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hispanics and 1 per 100,000 in non-Hispanic Blacks and Asians/Pacific Islanders.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Chronic solar damage from UV exposure leads to “photoaging” of the skin. The skin changes of photoaging are distinct from changes caused by chronologic aging. In photoaging, UV radiation induces an inflammatory cytokine cascade that leads to collagen degradation. Over time, this degradation manifests as cutaneous atrophy, mottled pigmentation, wrinkling, dryness, telangiectasia, and decreased skin elasticity. In comparison, chronologic aging is characterized by fine lines and decreased skin elasticity. Given that darker pigmentation attenuates the effect of UV radiation on skin, patients with darker skin tend to experience delayed and less severe photoaging.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Adverse effects of UV radiation can be prevented via photoprotective behaviors including topical sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, avoiding the sun at noon, and seeking shade. Providers should ask patients about their current sun-protective habits and encourage them to pursue these measures.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">NONMELANOMA SKIN CANCER (KERATINOCYTE CARCINOMA)</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Actinic Keratoses</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition <span class="p">Actinic keratoses (AK) are precancerous lesions classically found in sun-exposed areas of the body.

They can coalesce to form plaques, and their color can vary from skin-colored, to erythematous, pink, or brown (<span class="s1">Figure 93-1</span>). The overlaying scale is typically white or yellow, and adherent during palpation or light pressure. AKs are classically described as feeling “gritty” or “sandpaper- like” to the touch. In many cases, AKs might be more easily discernable via palpation than visual inspection.</p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIGURE 93-1. <span class="s5">Actinic keratosis of the scalp.

Of these, it is most important to differentiate AKs from SCCs and superficial BCCs. It is clinically difficult to make this distinction with certainty if the lesion is indurated or hypertrophic, in which case a biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Other common confounders include seborrheic keratoses (differentiated by well-defined borders and a “stuck on” appearance) and solar lentigo (a dark brown macule with an irregular outline). AKs can also be confused with eczema, dry skin, or guttate psoriasis.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Course and complications <span class="p">While most AKs remain stable or undergo spontaneous remission, a small percentage of them develop into cutaneous SCCs. This change, if it does occur, happens over the course of several years in immunocompetent individuals. The cumulative risk for malignant change depends on the number of lesions and their chronicity.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Basal Cell Carcinoma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition <span class="p">BCC is the most common type of skin cancer. It originates from tumor progenitor cells that are typically within the basal layer of the epidermis, or less commonly, from the hair follicle. There are three major types of BCCs based on clinical presentation and histopathology: (1) nodular, (2) superficial, and (3) morpheaform (scarring, sclerotic).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Risk factors </span>BCCs can either be sporadic—resultant from UV damage (refer to <i>Etiology </i>for a thorough discussion on UV radiation) or ionizing radiation (x- ray)—or hereditary, associated with a genetic syndrome or mutation. Over 90% of both sporadic and hereditary BCCs display uncontrolled Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. The Hh pathway is essential to normal skin development, playing a role in both cell growth and keratinocyte proliferation. Both inactivating mutations of the tumor-suppressor patched (<i>PTCH</i>) gene and activating mutations of the proto-oncogene smoothened (<i>SMO</i>) have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of BCCs. These mutations result in the unregulated activation of the Hh pathway, leading to promotion of growth and cancer development in tumor progenitor cells within the epidermis and hair follicle.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical presentation</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s248">Nodular </span>The most common BCC subtype is the well circumscribed or nodular variant. This typically begins as a small translucent or waxy flesh-colored or pink, pearly papule or nodule with arborizing vessels on the surface and a translucent, sometimes rolled, border (<span class="s1">Figure 93-2</span>). With time, the nodule increases in size and can undergo central ulceration. Although pigmentation can be seen in all BCC subtypes, it is most common in nodular BCCs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Nodular BCCs tend to present on the head and neck.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 93-2. <span class="s5">Nodular BCC on the lower eyelid.

They present as ill-defined pink to red, flat, scaly lesions, sometimes with a fine, thread-like translucent border (<span class="s1">Figure 93-3</span>). The middle of the lesion can erode over time, leaving an atrophic central clearing. As their name suggests, superficial BCCs grow with peripheral extension, which can lead to significant superficial subclinical involvement. BCC of the trunk tends to be superficial BCC.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 93-3. <span class="s5">Superficial BCC occurring on the chest.

It usually presents as a flat, firm, indurated, pale, white-to-yellow papule or plaque with ulceration, indistinct clinical borders, and a “scar-like” appearance (<span class="s1">Figure 93-4</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Morpheaform BCCs may exhibit subclinical extension widely beyond (&gt; 1 cm) their apparent borders with distant, small finger-like projections of tumor cells that may invade deep into the dermis, subcutis, and muscle, skating along fascial planes, cartilage, and bone. These projections can be missed with standard histologic margin control and therefore morpheaform BCCs have a higher rate of recurrence following standard treatment modalities.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 93-4. <span class="s5">Aggressive BCC on the nose.

Sebaceous hyperplasia can be confused with a nodular BCC due to its presentation as a yellow papule with overlaying telangiectasias and a central pore. Other lesions on the differential for BCCs include skin-colored nevi and benign hair follicle tumors of the face. Of note, superficial BCCs can be mistaken for eczema or other erythematous, well demarcated rashes, which should be considered if a patient has a plaque that is not responsive to standard therapies. It is most important, however, to ensure differentiation between the three main types of skin cancer: BCCs, SCCs, and melanoma. Any lesion suspicious for cutaneous carcinoma should be biopsied. Histologic processing will be able to differentiate between the three.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Course and complications <span class="p">BCCs typically grow indolently for years but are capable of sudden exponential growth. Occult local invasion may be deep and asymmetric with root-like extensions sometimes several centimeters beyond the lesion’s clinically apparent borders. If left untreated, relentless growth can lead to extensive local destruction, ulceration, drainage,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bleeding, infection, and disfigurement. Depending on the tumor’s location, it can invade bone and even impair function of vital structures such as the eyes, nose, or ears. Neglect of BCCs until they present with significant morbidity can be particularly prevalent among older adults, where factors such as functional and cognitive impairment, low socioeconomic status, and lack of social support can all delay their presentation to the health care system.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Metastasis is rare, however does occur, particularly if the lesion is larger than 2 cm in diameter, on the head and neck, and invades beyond fat. The estimated incidence of BCC metastasis ranges from 0.0028% to 0.55%.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recurrence is more likely than metastasis, even though the risk of recurrence is small after any standard treatment. Since BCCs grow slowly, recurrence is more likely several years after treatment of the initial tumor, with studies finding that 56% of recurrences occurred 5 years or more after the primary tumor was definitively treated. The risk of a new primary skin cancer is higher than either metastasis or recurrence, for example, for men with SCC, 28% will develop a BCC. Regular follow-up should therefore be provided to these patients, generally in the form of a skin check once a year.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Squamous Cell Carcinoma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition <span class="p">SCC is the second most common type of skin cancer. The majority of cutaneous SCCs develop from AKs; yet, while AKs are considered to be precancerous lesions, not every AK develops into an SCC. Most SCCs are low-risk lesions that have high cure rates following treatment. It should be noted, however, that SCCs do have the potential to metastasize.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Risk factors </span>Just as with other skin cancers, SCCs occur most often in patients with high levels of chronic sun exposure (refer to the <i>Etiology </i>section for a thorough discussion on UV radiation). SCCs also have several additional unique risk factors. Conditions that can predispose patients to SCC development include ionizing radiation (x-ray), arsenic exposure, scarring from a previous injury such as a burn, and chronic inflammatory processes like wounds or ulcers, osteomyelitis sinuses, or discoid lupus. Viruses, in particular the human papillomavirus (HPV), are also implicated. Although HPV is classically associated with cervical SCC, it has also been linked to cutaneous SCC. This association was first reported in the genetic disorder epidermodysplasia verruciformis. Patients with this disorder develop hundreds of warts, and those warts that are caused by HPV-5 in sun-exposed areas frequently become cutaneous SCC.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The biggest risk factor for SCC, however, is immunosuppression. SCC is the most common skin cancer in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients, occurring 65 to 250 times more frequently in these patients than in the general population. Light-skinned, immunosuppressed individuals can quickly develop large numbers of AKs which tend to behave aggressively and transform into invasive, rapidly growing SCCs with an increased risk for metastasis. It has been shown that the development of cutaneous SCCs in solid organ transplant recipients is proportional to the intensity of their immunosuppressive regimen, with an increased number of immunosuppressive agents correlating to higher rates of cutaneous SCC formation. Of note, transplant patients with skin of color also develop SCC at high rates, but their lesions are more likely to be found in non–sun-exposed sites, necessitating a careful and thorough skin examination.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Clinical presentation </span>A majority of cutaneous SCCs (80%) develop in chronically sun-exposed areas on the head and neck. Clinical presentation varies, but most often SCCs are 0.5 to 1.5 cm firm, sometimes tender, hyperkeratotic pink to red papules, nodules, or plaques that may bleed (<span class="s1">Figures 93-5</span>, <span class="s1">93-6</span>, and <span class="s1">93-7</span>). The center of the lesion can become ulcerated or crusted and has the potential for rapid and deep invasion. In darker skinned patients, SCC may present in non–sun-exposed areas and be associated with chronic inflammatory or scarring processes.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 93-5. <span class="s5">Invasive SCC on the cheek.

Keratoacanthomas tend to grow rapidly, usually over the course of 4 to 6 weeks. They present as a flesh-colored nodule with a central hyperkeratotic crater (<span class="s1">Figure 93-8</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although they may spontaneously involute, excision is often recommended for keratoacanthomas since their clinical course is difficult to predict.</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 93-8. <span class="s5">Keratoacanthoma on the back (black arrow).

Any lesion suspicious for cancer, including persistent ulcers, should be biopsied.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Course and complications <span class="p">Although the majority of cutaneous SCCs are low-risk lesions that have high cure rates when treated, SCCs do have the potential to metastasize. Lesions that are more likely to metastasize tend to have a diameter &gt; 2 cm, invade deep into the dermis and can have perineural involvement, are recurrent or occur at high-risk sites (eg, ear, lips), develop in scarred skin, or are in immunosuppressed patients. The regional lymph nodes are often the first site of metastasis, involved in approximately 85% to 90% of metastatic cases. Around 10% to 15% of metastases involve distant sites such as the lungs, liver, brain, bone, and skin. The prognosis for patients with metastatic SCC is poor, with 10-year survival rates of less than 20% for patients with advanced regional lymph node involvement and less than 10% for patients with distant metastases.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment for AKs and Keratinocyte Carcinoma</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AKs do not require biopsy. Biopsy is, however, mandatory to confirm the diagnosis in lesions suspicious for keratinocyte carcinoma. Numerous surgical and nonsurgical modalities are effective in treating BCC and SCC. The selection of therapy is based on several clinical and histologic risk factors noted in <span class="s1">Table 93-2</span>. The majority of lesions are relatively low-risk and can be treated effectively with control rates greater than 90% for low- risk tumors treated by techniques such as cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy, electrodessication and curettage (ED&amp;C), surgical excision, or radiation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additional field destruction procedures such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) can also be used. For lesions complicated by high-risk factors, noted in <span class="s1">Table 93-2</span>, the control (cure) rate drops precipitously. High-risk lesions are usually treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) or surgical excision with comprehensive margin control.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 93-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>BASAL CELL CARCINOMA (BCC) AND SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (SCC) HIGH-RISK FACTORS FOR OCCULT SUBCLINICAL INVASION AND RECURRENCE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cryothe rapy <span class="p">Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is the gold standard treatment for isolated AKs. Liquid nitrogen (–196°C) is directly sprayed on the lesion, destroying it via intracellular and extracellular ice formation. The spraying, or “freezing,” should last about 10 seconds, during which the patient will feel a burning or stinging at the site. The lesion is then allowed to thaw, and a repeat freeze-thaw cycle should be performed. Although generally reserved for AKs, cryotherapy can be a highly effective treatment for BCCs or SCCs when timed and performed under local anesthesia or done with thermocouples to measure temperature. Cryotherapy is generally well tolerated by older adults.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Topical chemothe rapy (5-fluorouracil, imiquimod) <span class="p">The two main topical chemotherapeutic agents available are topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and imiquimod. Both are used to treat large areas with multiple AKs where localized cryotherapy would be impractical. The 5% strength versions of 5- FU and imiquimod can also be used to treat select biopsy-confirmed low- risk superficial BCCs. Although both topical agents have similar indications,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">they work via different mechanisms: imiquimod is a toll-like receptor-7 agonist that induces an immune response against atypical keratinocytes, and 5-FU is a pyrimidine analog that blocks DNA synthesis by inhibiting the</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">enzyme thymidylate synthetase. In head-to-head comparisons, 5-FU is thought to be more effective for the treatment of AKs than imiquimod. Clinical trials for both 5-FU and imiquimod did not find any significant differences in the safety and efficacy of the topical agents between older and younger adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients should be warned though, that both topical therapies can cause significant skin irritation, dryness, and burning. 5-FU should be applied to AKs once a day for up to 4 weeks, whereas imiquimod should be applied two times per week for 16 weeks. If using either agent for BCCs, refer to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels for appropriate dosing. 5-FU and imiquimod can also be used off-label to treat SCC in situ.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Photodynamic the rapy <span class="p">PDT can be used to treat AKs and keratinocyte carcinomas. It is a two-step process: a photosensitizing agent is applied to the area being treated, and then light irradiation is administered to the same area to activate the drug. The two traditional photosensitizing agents used are methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) (no longer available in the United States) and 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Both agents are absorbed by neoplastic cells and then converted into porphyrins. Porphyrins are particularly efficient at absorbing visible light, and when activated by light in the presence of oxygen, the resultant chemical reactions lead to cell death. In order to allow for an adequate buildup of porphyrins, photosensitizing agents may be left on the skin for several hours prior to irradiation. The irradiating light source is typically red, blue, or broadband, but pulsed dye laser can also be used.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although surgical excision is more likely to result in complete clearance and reduced recurrence rates compared to PDT, PDT may be associated with a better cosmetic outcome.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">PDT is a good option to consider in older adults who are not appropriate surgical candidates or who are unable or unwilling to apply daily topical medications. It is generally well tolerated, with the main adverse effect being pain or burning at the site of treatment. This burning can be particularly severe if the lesion is located on the head. In practice, pain is often the most cited cause of PDT discontinuation among older patients, so providers should consider administering analgesics, anesthetics, or cold air when treating extensive lesions, particularly if on the head.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ele ctrodessication and curettage <span class="p">ED&amp;C is a common, effective treatment option for thick AKs as well as low-risk keratinocyte cancers in low-risk areas. Results are operator-dependent. Reported 5-year cure rates range from 91% to 97% for both cutaneous SCC and BCC. ED&amp;C is quickly performed in the office with local anesthesia. First, a curette is used to remove the gross tumor, which is soft and friable. This is followed by electrodessication of the periphery and base of the wound to destroy residual tumor cells. Depending on the size and feel of the lesion, this process is repeated for two to four cycles. The resulting wound heals by granulation with a hypopigmented, atrophic, or sometimes depressed, scar. ED&amp;C can be first choice treatment for small superficial lesions or SCC in situ but may also be considered for older patients who are otherwise not good surgical candidates.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radiation the rapy <span class="p">Fractionated radiation therapy (RT) may be used for both BCC and SCC, with 5-year cure rates for both types of keratinocyte carcinoma ranging from 90% to 96%. RT should be used to treat patients in whom surgery is contraindicated or in whom surgical excision would result in a poor functional outcome. Radiotherapeutic modalities include interstitial brachytherapy, superficial x-rays, electrons, and megavoltage photons. Each treatment session of RT is considered a fraction, and these fractions are summated to calculate a total dose. Fractionation allows for normal tissue to repair cellular damage prior to the next RT session; malignant cells, however, have limited capability to do so. Although RT is associated with “late effects” of hypopigmentation and epidermal atrophy after multiple treatments, these cosmetic issues are typically not a major concern for older adults. Therefore, while younger patients usually receive 2 to 2.5 Gy (RT units) over 4 to 5 weeks in order to minimize late effects, treatment for older adults instead aims to decrease course length, with a typical schedule involving 3 to 4 Gy over 2 to 3 weeks. Hypofractionation, or less frequent administration of greater Gy, is recommended for older adults (eg, 5–7 Gy in 5–6 fractions). Compared to normal fractionation, where patients need to receive daily treatment, hypofractionation can allow for older patients with significant comorbidity or poor overall status to receive treatment on alternating days or even just once a week. Even with hypofractionation though, RT still requires multiple visits, which can make it difficult for older adults to attend, especially if they rely on a caregiver to bring them to the doctor. Providers should also be aware that there is an increased likelihood of developing skin cancer secondary to RT 15 years after completion of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">therapy, and it is therefore not ideal for patients with a life expectancy greater than 15 years.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surgical excision <span class="p">Surgical excision is the standard of care for an older adult who has a skin cancer that does not have any concerning features (eg, large size or aggressive pathology) and is not in the head/neck region or in an area that has compromised vascular supply (eg, the lower legs in patients with venous stasis). It is an effective treatment modality for all types of keratinocyte carcinoma and possesses the advantage of supplying a tissue specimen for histologic assessment of margins. Five-year disease-free rates with surgical excision are 98% for low-risk BCC and higher than 91% for low-risk SCC. When compared to destructive techniques, excisions tend to heal rapidly and with superior cosmetic results. Most excisional procedures can be performed in a treatment room with local anesthesia, but rarely, an extensive procedure may require intravenous sedation or general anesthesia in the operating room. Recommended margins for keratinocyte carcinoma excision generally range from 4 to 10 mm, with the deep margin in mid fat.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">High-risk lesions require wider margins to ensure clearance and achieve high control rates. If histopathologic processing indicates that the lesion was incompletely excised, then additional therapeutic intervention should be sought, or re-excision should be performed via MMS.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mohs micrographic surgery <span class="p">MMS is considered the gold standard for removal of high-risk keratinocyte carcinoma. Factors to take into consideration in determining if a lesion is high risk include the type and subtype of cancer, the location, whether the tumor is primary or recurrent, its size, and the patient’s health status. Cure rates with MMS for high-risk primary cutaneous SCCs that have a high likelihood of recurrence with other treatments have been reported as up to 96%. Primary BCCs treated with MMS have only a 1% recurrence rate.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">MMS is a specialized form of dermatologic surgery that involves serial tangential excisions with real-time microscopic evaluation of the entirety of the surgical margins to ensure that the tumor is excised completely. Each excision involves removing cancerous tissue with 1 to 3 mm margins per stage and then microscopically examining the entire undersurface and edges of the specimen (the entire true margin) cut as en face horizontal sections. If residual cancer cells are noted at a margin, the precise location is mapped and identified on the patient. Then, another layer of tissue at the corresponding site of the residual tumor is excised and examined</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">microscopically for cancer cells. This process continues layer by layer in stages until no detectable cancer cells remain at the surgical margin. MMS aims to preserve the maximum amount of normal tissue possible, and since nearly 100% of the margin is examined, it results in exceedingly high rates of local control. Reconstruction is usually performed without delay after tumor- free margins are confirmed. Rarely, adjuvant RT may be indicated in cases of extensive perineural spread and cases with a higher risk of local recurrence, but the ability to achieve clear margins surgically is the single best indicator of successful cure. MMS is performed by experienced surgeons who have undergone advanced postgraduate ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) fellowship training and are adept at microscopic interpretation of horizontally cut frozen sections and local flap and graft soft tissue reconstruction techniques. It is often the extensive repair that follows MMS which contributes to morbidity in older adults, rather than the serial excisions of MMS itself. In cases involving large defects or very complex tumors, it is important to have a collaborative, multidisciplinary team approach.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Providers can use the free Mohs Surgery Appropriate Use Criteria app to determine their patient’s suitability for MMS. Even though it may be appropriate, the procedure can be long and tedious and therefore is perhaps not the most desired treatment for all older adults. It is important to consider the patient’s functional status and any physical or cognitive limitations that would make them poor candidates for this form of surgery. Patients who do pursue MMS tend to be highly functioning, or if they are lower functioning, have large symptomatic tumors that severely negatively impact their quality of life. As with any surgical procedure, MMS presents with risk of wound dehiscence, bleeding, pain or tenderness at the surgical site, and infection.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Large scale studies have reported no difference in incidence of postsurgical complications between older and younger adults (7% across both patients ≥ 80 and &lt; 80), with one study even reporting that the mean postoperative pain score in adults younger than 66 was significantly greater than in those who were older. While many in the dermatologic community have concluded that MMS is a safe and effective treatment for keratinocyte carcinoma in older adults, it is important for providers to have a thorough discussion with older patients and their families on the risks and benefits of this procedure, as well as expectations for the day of surgery.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment of nodal disease with keratinocyte carcinoma <span class="p">If keratinocyte carcinoma metastasizes to involve the regional lymph nodes (more commonly seen with SCC), then nodal disease is treated with complete lymph node dissection. If indicated by the number of involved nodes and the status of extranodal extension, adjuvant local RT can be administered.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Systemic the rapy for BCC <span class="p">Systemic therapy should be considered for patients who have exhausted other therapeutic modalities. Although a few trials have reported that SCC responds to systemic cytotoxic therapy, there is currently no standard accepted systemic treatment for SCC, though PD-1 inhibitors are gaining in popularity. BCCs, on the other hand, have two accepted systemic therapeutic options: vismodegib and sonidegib.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Vismodegib (brand name Erivedge) and sonidegib (brand name Odomzo) are Hh pathway inhibitors that bind and inhibit smoothened (SMO). Erivedge was approved by the FDA in 2012 and Odomzo in 2015. Both drugs are indicated for the treatment of metastatic BCC or locally advanced inoperable BCC in patients who are not candidates for RT. Vismodegib’s reported objective response rates approach 33% for metastatic disease and 48% for locally advanced BCC, with sonidegib similarly at 15% for metastatic disease and 43% for locally advanced BCC. Common adverse effects for both drugs include muscle spasms, alopecia, weight loss, fatigue, dysgeusia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. Unfortunately, clinical studies of Erivedge did not include a sufficient number of older adults to determine whether safety and efficacy differ between older and younger patients. Trials of Odomzo, however, did—reporting that 54% of patients in Study 1 were 65 and older. Although no difference in efficacy was observed between older and younger patients, older adults who took Odomzo were found to have a higher incidence of serious adverse events, grade 3 (severe but not immediately life-threatening) and grade 4 (urgently life-threatening) adverse events, and events that required dose disruption or medication discontinuation. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation included muscle spasms and dysgeusia, asthenia, increased lipase, and nausea. Given this risk of severe musculoskeletal adverse events, creatinine kinase levels should be obtained prior to initiating sonidegib therapy and should be monitored throughout the therapeutic course, with discontinuation if indicated.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Prescribers should also be aware of several key drug interactions with the Hh pathway inhibitors. Drugs that inhibit vismodegib’s drug transporter</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, and azithromycin increase systemic exposure to vismodegib and the risk of adverse events. Vismodegib’s FDA label also cautions that proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids, and other drugs that alter the pH of the digestive system may potentially reduce the bioavailability of vismodegib, though this has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Increasing the dose of vismodegib in patients on these medications, however, might not compensate for its potentially reduced bioavailability. Although sonidegib is not noted to have the same interactions with pH-altering drugs, concomitant administration with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, diltiazem) should be avoided.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Follow-Up</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thirty to fifty percent of patients with keratinocyte carcinoma will develop another primary carcinoma within 5 years and are at increased risk of developing melanoma. Therefore, it is important that patients with keratinocyte carcinoma have regular skin examinations and receive education on utilizing sun protection and performing monthly self-skin examinations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For SCC in particular, recurrence most often happens within the first 2 years, so close follow-up during this time frame is indicated for SCC patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Providers should observe the primary site of the initial lesion for signs of recurrence, and regional lymph nodes should be evaluated for lymphadenopathy indicative of metastatic disease. These patients should be taught to perform self-examinations of their lymph nodes in concordance with their self-skin examinations. For BCCs in patients with limited life expectancy, some providers also consider active surveillance appropriate when lesions are in low-risk areas without other risk factors. Since BCCs are generally indolent and slow-growing, active surveillance can help patients avoid unnecessary treatments while closely monitoring for tumor growth or development of symptoms. Although active surveillance is not the standard of care, it is an option that providers can discuss with their patients when managing low-risk lesions.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MELANOMA</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Melanoma results from the malignant transformation of melanocytes usually located at the dermal-epidermal junction. When confined to the epidermis, melanoma is termed melanoma in situ. With time, melanoma invades</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">vertically into the dermis where it can metastasize to the regional lymph nodes and other distant organs via the lymphatic or vascular systems. The deeper the melanoma invades, the greater the risk of metastasis and advanced systemic disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The incidence of melanoma has been steadily rising over the years. In 2010, the American Cancer Society estimated that 68,130 patients would be diagnosed with melanoma that year. This number jumped to 100,350 estimated cases in 2020. When comparing data across 2007 to 2016, it has been found that the incidence of melanoma has increased 2.2% per year in adults over 50, yet during the same timeframe has decreased by 1.2% in individuals younger than 50. Older adults with melanoma also have a higher mortality rate compared to younger patients. Although new treatments have led to decreased mortality across age groups, trends for younger adults started to dip beginning in the mid-1980s but have only been going down for older adults in the past decade. Data from 2013 to 2017 show a decline in melanoma-related mortality by 7.0% in adults younger than 50, but only 5.7% in older adults. Melanoma’s higher mortality rate and worse prognosis in older patients are thought to be because they often present with more aggressive prognostic features, such as thicker depth and higher mitotic rates.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk Factors</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As with the keratinocyte carcinomas, the main risk factors for melanoma are UV exposure, a history of blistering sunburns, and light complexion. Patients with congenital nevi (CN), or nevi that are present at birth or appear within the first 6 months of life, also have an increased risk for developing melanoma. Large (≥ 20 cm) CN tend to progress to melanoma prior to age 10, and since melanoma may originate deep in the lesion, melanoma nested within CN tends to be detected late. Personal and family history of melanoma are also important risk factors. Five to fifteen percent of melanoma patients endorse a positive family history of melanoma and 5% to 10% of individuals with a personal history of prior melanoma develop a second primary melanoma.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Genetics also play a large role in melanoma risk. CDKN2A, CDK4, BAP1, and TERT are considered melanoma predisposition genes, and are implicated in both somatic and familial mutations leading to melanoma. Of these, mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 are the most common in familial melanoma and are found in 45% of cases. Familial occurrence of melanoma</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is also seen with the familial atypical multiple mole-melanoma syndrome, which is due to a germline mutation in CDKN2A. Criteria for diagnosis of this syndrome include cutaneous melanoma in at least one first- or second- degree relative and greater than 50 total body nevi with multiple atypical nevi that have specific histologic features (eg, subepidermal fibroplasia). It should be noted, however, that dysplastic nevi are not technically considered as “premelanoma” because the melanoma in these patients may arise de novo in normal skin.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The genetic discoveries that have perhaps been the most critical to shaping our understanding and treatment of melanoma are those in the MAPK signaling pathway. The MAPK pathway (also known as the Ras-Raf-MEK- ERK pathway) transfers extracellular signaling intracellularly via a phosphorylation cascade, influencing cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. One of the kinases in this pathway is BRAF, a proto-oncogene that when mutated can become constitutively activated, leading to unopposed cellular growth, a forebearer of neoplastic transformation. BRAF mutations have been discovered in 50% to 70% of melanomas, and 90% of those mutations are missense point mutations which result in the substitution of</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">glutamic acid for valine at amino acid 600, known as BRAF<span class="s22">V600E</span>. This has led to the development of BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib (further discussed under <i>Systemic Therapy</i>).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Presentation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Melanoma can arise anywhere on the skin surface. Approximately one-third of melanomas arise from a melanocyte within a preexisting pigmented lesion, and two-thirds arise within scattered melanocytes, developing on clinically normal-appearing skin. The most frequent site for melanoma in men is the trunk, particularly the upper back and shoulders. In women, the most frequent site of melanoma is on the legs. Although rare, it should also be noted that melanoma can occur in the mucosa, genitals, nail beds, and ocular sites. In dark skinned individuals, melanoma is most common on the palms and soles of the feet.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The earliest clinical features of melanoma include a change in the size, shape, or color of a lesion. Persistent itching of a lesion can also occasionally be an early clinical feature of melanoma. Later features include ulceration, bleeding, and tenderness. The clinical changes associated with melanoma can be remembered by the ABCD rule (<span class="s1">Table 93-3</span>, <span class="s1">Figure 93-9</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“A” stands for asymmetry—one half of the lesion is not a mirror image of the other half. “B” stands for irregular borders—the edges of the lesion might appear ragged, notched, jagged, scalloped, or fuzzy. “C” stands for color, since the lesion will typically lack homogenous pigmentation throughout; varying and mottled shades of tan, dark brown to jet-black, or shades of red, white, and/or blue may be present. Historically, “D” stood for a diameter greater than 6 mm; however, this has proven to be relatively insensitive as an independent factor. Therefore, in many melanoma centers, “D” stands for difference. This could be interpreted as any change or difference in an individual lesion, especially with respect to size, shape, color, or persistent itching. “Difference” could also refer to being suspicious of a lesion that</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">looks <span class="p">different from others, which is known as the “ugly duckling sign.” This means that in patients with multiple normal or slightly abnormal-appearing nevi, any isolated lesion that appears different from the overwhelming majority should be regarded with suspicion and biopsied for further testing. “D” can also stand for dark since melanoma is typically heavily pigmented even when very small. The ABCD rule has now been expanded to include “E,” denoting how evolution or change in any of the ABCD characteristics is what can be most concerning for melanoma.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 93-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>ABCDS OF MELANOMA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 93-9. <span class="s5">Melanoma displaying the typical ABCD characteristics—asymmetry, irregular borders, varying colors, and diameter &gt; 6 mm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Providers, however, should be aware that not all melanomas will display every ABCD characteristic, and that early melanomas can even lack all of these classic features. Therefore, any changing pigmented lesion or new atypical lesion should be evaluated with a low threshold for biopsy, especially if the patient has risk factors for melanoma. Since only 33% of melanomas develop within preexisting nevi though, there is no indication for prophylactic removal of preexisting nevi. It should also be noted that 3% to 4% of melanomas completely lack pigmentation; these amelanotic melanomas are understandably often detected at later stages of development than pigmented lesions (<span class="s1">Figure 93-10</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIGURE 93-10. <span class="s5">Amelanotic melanoma.

This type of melanoma is particularly common in older adults and is most often located on sun-damaged skin, for example, the head and neck. It usually begins as a pigmented macular lesion with variation in black and brown color. It typically has an irregular outline, and over the course of several years it can darken and enlarge (<span class="s1">Figures 93- 14 </span>and <span class="s1">93-15</span>). The in situ phase of this lesion is known as lentigo maligna. Once histologic invasion is documented, it is termed lentigo maligna melanoma.

It often arises without evidence of a preexisting lesion. Nodular melanoma has a minimal lateral growth phase, and instead grows vertically early in the course of the disease. Due to this early vertical growth, nodular melanoma typically has invaded substantially by the time of detection, leading to a worse prognosis. Clinically, nodular melanoma appears as a raised, nodular, or polypoid lesion with relatively uniform color and regular borders (<span class="s1">Figure 93-16</span>).

For superficial spreading melanoma that list includes atypical nevi, pigmented BCC, and seborrheic keratoses; for nodular melanoma— angiokeratoma, blue nevi, and dermatofibroma. Nevi and the rare fungal infection tinea nigra palmaris should be considered in the differential for acral lentiginous melanoma.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Course and Complications</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classifies melanoma based on the tumor thickness (T), nodal status (N), and metastatic disease</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(M) staging system. There are five stages, with each successive stage associated with a worse prognosis and deeper invasion into the dermis (Breslow depth): stage 0 (in situ melanoma), stage I (local disease with no evidence of spread), stage II (local disease with deeper invasion into the dermis but still no evidence of spread), stage III (evidence of spread to regional lymph nodes or skin), and stage IV (distant metastases). The more distal the metastases, the poorer the prognosis. Frequent sites of metastases include the lymph nodes, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. Visceral metastases most commonly involve the lungs, liver, brain, bone, and intestines, though they may occur in any organ.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Clinically, node-negative patients with significant risk of regional nodal disease at the time of diagnosis are staged via a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), ideally performed at the time of definitive treatment of the primary site. The lymph node status and nodal tumor burden (based on SLNB) are incorporated into the current AJCC staging system. A thorough description of prognosis based on Breslow depth and other prognostic factors is found in a seminal article by Balch et al.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Treatment of Melanoma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Biopsy considerations <span class="p">All lesions clinically concerning for melanoma should be biopsied via a full-thickness excision with narrow margins (2 mm) oriented parallel to the lines of lymphatic drainage, or a deep saucerization shave</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">biopsy of the complete lesion. The goal of biopsy is to remove the entire clinical lesion for comprehensive histologic evaluation. A superficial shave biopsy is never recommended for a lesion suspicious for melanoma; if the melanoma is transected with a shave biopsy then it will be difficult to accurately determine the thickness of the tumor. For suspicious lesions too large for complete excision, a full-thickness incisional biopsy deep enough to avoid transecting the lesion at the deep margin may be performed using an ellipse, deep saucerization shave, or punch. Incisional biopsies of melanoma do not increase the risk of metastasis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, permanent sections are required for accurate microstaging and diagnosis of the primary lesion.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surgical excision of the primary tumor <span class="p">Surgical excision of the primary tumor is the standard therapy for melanoma to prevent local recurrence caused by persistent disease. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines include recommendations for lateral margins, which are based on the depth of invasion of the lesion. The deep margin of the excision should be in the deep fat or in the tissue plane above the fascia. Excision specimens are sent to the pathologist for confirmation or change of the histologic stage of disease, as well as evaluation of the surgical margins. Since lentigo maligna, or the superficial portions of the lentigo maligna melanoma, can extend subclinically, excision with 5 mm margins often yields tumor at the margin, leading to recurrence. For these lesions, excision with margin control is necessary. A modification of the MMS procedure with permanent sections is often used, having an excellent success rate of less than 2% recurrence in many studies with long-term follow-up. A comparison study at the Mayo Clinic of wide local excision versus frozen section MMS for lentigo maligna had 5.9% versus 1.9% recurrence rates, respectively.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Lentigo maligna without evidence of invasive melanoma can also be treated with imiquimod cream used five times a week for 12 or more weeks to the point of inflammation, or with RT. An older patient with limited life expectancy could have the lesion observed, utilizing follow-up examination, lesion photography, dermoscopy, or possibly confocal laser microscopy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sentine l lymph node biopsy and regional lymph node management <span class="p">Melanoma’s spread to the regional nodal basin typically begins with initial metastasis to one lymph node, referred to as the sentinel lymph node (SLN). The SLN can be identified by use of radiolabeled colloid lymphatic tracers plus blue dye injected intradermally at the site of the primary lesion. The tracers and dye</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">then drain from the primary lesion, traveling through the lymphatic vessels and collecting in the SLN. This node (or nodes if multiple collect dye) is then removed for careful histologic evaluation with immunohistochemical staining. The entire process is termed the SLNB and is performed as an outpatient procedure. The accuracy of SLNB requires injection of tracers at the site of the primary lesion, so ideally SLNB is completed concurrently with wide local excision, ensuring that tracers are injected at the most appropriate site. If the SLNB is negative for melanoma, no further treatment is indicated. If instead, the SLNB is positive for melanoma, then patients should consider regional therapeutic lymphadenectomy and may be eligible for adjuvant therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The NCCN melanoma guidelines recommend considering SLNB in patients with high-risk stage IB (Breslow depth &gt; 1 mm or 0.76–1.0 mm thick lesions with high-risk features) or stage II melanoma, for whom SLN status is the strongest independent predictor of survival. High-risk features for regional metastasis warranting SLNB in thin melanoma (0.76–1.0 mm thick) include young patient age, ulceration of the primary lesion, angiolymphatic</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">invasion, a mitotic rate of greater than or equal to 1 mitosis/mm<span class="s22">2</span>, or a positive deep margin on the initial biopsy. SLNB is not recommended for stage 0 melanoma, or very thin (≤ 0.75 mm) lesions that are stage IA or 1B.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although SLNB is generally well tolerated, reported complication rates vary from 5% to 10%. Old age is one of the known risk factors for complications associated with SLNB, so it is important that older adults considering SLNB are well-educated on the risks and benefits of the procedure. Complications that are most likely to occur include wound dehiscence and infection, seroma/hematoma, and lymphedema. Other reported risks include allergic reactions to the dye used, nerve injury and thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, and hemorrhage. Given these risks, SLNB has remained controversial in older adults, and especially in the very old. A study at the University of Michigan, however, of 952 melanoma patients 75 years or older concluded that in patients with good functional status who were appropriate surgical candidates, SLNB should be strongly considered; it was found to be associated with improved outcomes, even after factoring in age and comorbidities.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">SLNB allows for early identification of patients with nodal disease and for immediate intervention with completion lymph node dissection (CLND). Although data on improved clinical outcomes with CLND are conflicting, the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">procedure is still recommended by the NCCN for patients with stage III disease or a positive SLNB. The NCCN panel determined, however, that there was insufficient evidence to detail a specific number of lymph nodes that have to be removed in lymph node basins in order for CLND to be considered adequate.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjuvant the rapy</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjuvant radiation therapy <span class="p">NCCN guidelines recommend considering adjuvant RT following surgery for patients with desmoplastic melanoma, or melanoma that involves nerve fibers, otherwise known as neurotropic melanoma. These tumors are at high risk of recurrence, which can be ameliorated by adjuvant RT. For patients with positive nodes and a high risk of nodal basin relapse, however, the expert panel was unable to reach a consensus to recommend adjuvant RT. Although high-level evidence displays that adjuvant RT can delay relapse in these patients, some experts noted that this benefit could be outweighed by late RT-related toxicity. Therefore, the use of adjuvant RT in these patients should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjuvant systemic therapy <span class="p">Historically, interferon-α was used as adjuvant systemic therapy in surgical patients with no known metastases. Data have now shown that interferon-α is ineffective as a therapeutic for melanoma, with the field instead embracing targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These therapeutics were initially only used for stage IV disease; however, they are now often considered as adjuvant therapy in stage II disease.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Systemic the rapy</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s248">Targeted therapies </span>Targeted therapeutics for melanoma include the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib (brand name Zelboraf) and dabrafenib (brand name Tafinlar), developed to counteract the constitutively active BRAF kinase resultant from the mutation BRAF<span class="s22">V600E</span>. BRAF<span class="s22">V600E</span> mutations must be confirmed in patients prior to initiating targeted therapy. The kinase</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">immediately downstream from BRAF is MEK, and therefore constitutive BRAF activation in BRAF<span class="s22">V600E</span> leads to constitutive MEK activation. As such, BRAF inhibitors are often given in conjunction with MEK inhibitors (trametinib) for further efficacy. Clinical studies of vemurafenib did not</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">include a sufficient number of adults older than 65 years to determine the safety and efficacy of the drug in this population. Trials of dabrafenib did, however, include older adults. When dabrafenib was administered as a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">single agent for melanoma, no differences were observed in the safety and efficacy of the drug between older and younger patients. When given in conjunction with trametinib, efficacy remained the same across patient age, but older patients had an increased incidence of peripheral edema (26% vs 12%) and anorexia (21% vs 9%) when compared to younger adults. It should be noted that trials of trametinib as a single agent did not include sufficient numbers of older adults. Common adverse reactions for both vemurafenib and dabrafenib include arthralgias, alopecia, and skin papilloma, with vemurafenib additionally displaying photosensitivity, and dabrafenib hyperkeratosis and palmar-plantar erythrodysthesia syndrome. When dabrafenib was given in conjunction with trametinib as adjuvant treatment for melanoma or for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, common adverse reactions included pyrexia, rash, chills, and headache. Providers should additionally be aware that dabrafenib can decrease systemic exposure of warfarin, and the label recommends that during the initiation or discontinuation of dabrafenib in patients who receive warfarin, providers should frequently monitor the international normalized ratio (INR).</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Immunotherapies <span class="p">Immunotherapeutic treatment options for melanoma include ipilimumab (CTLA-4 inhibitor), nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor), and pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor). Both CTLA-4 and PD-1 are involved in immune checkpoints, which are inhibitory pathways that deter autoimmunity by preventing immune cells from indiscriminately attacking all cells and tissue that they come across. CLTA-4 decreases T-cell activity, and PD-1 inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Inhibiting these checkpoints effectively switches “on” T-cell activity against melanoma, inducing an antitumor immune response.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although insufficient numbers of older adults were included in trials for adjuvant melanoma treatment with Yervoy (ipilimumab) and in some of the trials for Opdivo (nivolumab), those trials across Yervoy, Opdivo, and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) that did include sufficient numbers of older adults, did not find any significant differences in the safety and efficacy of the drugs between younger and older adults. Common adverse reactions across CTLA-4 and PD-1 therapeutics include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, rash, and diarrhea, but providers should be aware that severe and fatal immune- mediated adverse reactions can occur with these medications. Such reactions include immune-mediated hepatitis, pneumonitis, endocrinopathies, and renal dysfunction.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Role of imaging in melanoma diagnosis <span class="p">In the case of an unremarkable history and physical examination in a patient with recently diagnosed melanoma, the NCCN recommends against routine imaging studies (computed tomography [CT], positron emission tomography [PET] scan, and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and lab tests for patients with stage I melanoma. These imaging modalities may be used for symptom-directed work-up for patients with stage II disease. Imaging for asymptomatic patients with stage III disease is generally felt to be low yield but may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Stage IV metastatic disease should be confirmed by tissue biopsy (either fine needle aspiration or open biopsy) when possible and it is recommended to perform additional staging with imaging and blood serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OTHER CUTANEOUS TUMORS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are a number of less common cutaneous tumors that are beyond the scope of this chapter.

The 5-year overall survival after diagnosis ranges from 51% for patients with local disease to 14% for those with distal metastases.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Risk factors </span>As with other skin cancers discussed in this chapter, the major risk factor for MCC is extensive UV exposure, with the typical patient being an older adult with light-colored skin (refer to the <i>Etiology </i>section for a thorough discussion on UV exposure). Other important risk factors include chronic immunosuppression and infection with the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Although MCV is typically a benign virus to which much of the world’s population is exposed to as children, MCV is found in the cells of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">eight out of 10 MCCs, suggesting that it has a significant oncogenic role in the development of this cancer.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical presentation and histology <span class="p">MCC commonly occurs on the sun-exposed skin of the head and neck in older adults.

The first consensus staging system for MCC was introduced in 2010 by the AJCC. The system follows the primary tumor (T), nodal status (N), and distant metastases (M) structure. Four stages exist, stage I (local disease with primary tumor &lt; 2 cm), stage II (local disease with larger tumor size), stage III (regional nodal disease), and stage IV (distant metastatic disease). Although MCC is capable of metastasizing to distal viscera, it commonly affects the regional nodal basin, with studies showing that even the smallest clinical tumors have at least 15% to 20% risk for occult metastatic disease in the regional lymph node basin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Given its aggressive nature and risk for metastasis, it is critical to identify and treat MCC early. Yet, in a study of more than 26,000 patients from the National Cancer Database, it was found that even after diagnosis, time to definitive surgical treatment for stage I to III MCC was significantly</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">longer for Black patients (58.9 days) than it was for non-Hispanic Whites (46.3 days). Of note, these disparities persisted for Medicare and private insurance, but not for Medicaid or uninsured patients, and occurred despite Black patients living closer to the hospital than non-Hispanic Whites. These findings highlight some of the many disparities in health care, bringing to attention the fact that minority patients often do not just experience delays in diagnosis, but unacceptable delays in treatment.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment for MCC <span class="p">The treatment of MCC is based on the staging and spread of the disease. Wide local excision can be used for management of the primary tumor, with radiation administered to the tumor bed and any regionally involved lymph nodes. Successful treatment has also been documented with a combination of narrow margin excision and RT, or even with just radiation alone. Distant metastases can be treated with chemotherapy, PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, or other targeted molecular therapies.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NUANCES IN TREATMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Throughout this chapter, multiple modalities of treatment have been discussed for skin cancer. While each treatment presents with its own data on efficacy and cure rates, ultimately, if an individualized approach is taken to choose the right treatment, it is possible to cure every local lesion. Yet, if the wrong treatment is chosen, then the cure rate diminishes. For example, while a 5-mm well-demarcated nodular BCC on the back should have a 99% cure rate via any treatment, this is not the case if the same tumor is in a more high- risk location, like the nasal ala. Such a tumor might require a procedure like MMS with very careful margin control. Another common situation is a 6 mm ulcerated nodular BCC on the lower nose. ED&amp;C in this site has a less than 50% cure rate. Radiation treatment has a 90% cure rate but would require multiple visits. For a 95+% cure rate with a one stage excision with delayed standard histologic evaluation, the procedure entails an excision through fat (to fascia) with at least 4 mm margins and requires reconstruction, likely with a flap and sutures. MMS with a 98% cure rate for this lesion will take place in 1 day, often without even a previous appointment for consultation, and generally result in a smaller and thinner defect that can heal by second intention, removing most of the morbidity and risk of complication from the surgical procedure. Providers must therefore be aware of all of the implications that come with discussing treatment. When patients and families</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hear the word “surgery,” they are often reflexively hesitant since they may picture a big operation in the operating room. On the other hand, they might be told that a procedure is minor and may not anticipate the need for a large reconstructive flap or graft. Care should therefore be taken to educate patients on the exact procedure that they will undergo, and thorough discussions between the treatment team and the patient should include details regarding the day of surgery, potential options for repair, and their implications. The patient’s concerns should be addressed, and they should have appropriate expectations for the procedure and ensuing recovery.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ultimately, the decision of which treatment to pursue is extremely nuanced and individualized. Several considerations particularly important in the geriatric population are discussed below.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">GERIATRIC PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO DERMATOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Given that skin cancer increasingly presents with advanced age, providers must be comfortable with triaging these lesions. For older adults, it is important to assess the mortality risk of the lesion (eg, concern for melanoma versus concern for superficial BCC) as well as the morbidity risk (eg, a</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">long-standing 2 cm BCC that constantly bleeds versus a new 5-mm lesion concerning for early BCC). These considerations can help when assessing appropriateness of treatment within the conceptual framework of principles such as life expectancy, functional status, and lag time to benefit. Biopsies should always be performed for lesions concerning for high-risk skin cancer, for example SCC in concerning locations or in immunosuppressed patients, melanoma, or MCC. Once a lesion is biopsied and diagnosed, treatment recommendations should be tailored to the individual. Factors to consider include patient preferences, as well as if the patient presents at the end of life, has multiple comorbidities, or the morbidity of treatment outweighs the benefits. While treatments are often well tolerated for skin cancers that are not considered “high risk,” active nonintervention can be reasonably considered in patients who are near the end of life, particularly if the lesion is asymptomatic. Palliative surgery, however, should still be an option for low-functioning adults if they have symptomatic lesions that significantly impair their quality of life (eg, pain, bleeding, pungent odor). For older adults, it is particularly important for dermatologists and geriatricians or</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">primary care providers to collaborate and involve both the patient and their family in treatment discussions, utilizing shared decision-making to marry medical advice with the patient’s desire for or against treatment of their lesion. Ultimately, when determining appropriate treatment in the aging population, it is crucial to weigh the patient’s overall status and their wishes over their chronological age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ad Hoc Task Force, Connolly SM, Baker DR, et al.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AAD/ACMS/ASDSA/ASMS 2012 appropriate use criteria for Mohs micrographic surgery: a report of the American Academy of Dermatology, American College of Mohs Surgery, American Society for Dermatologic Surgery Association, and the American Society for Mohs Surgery. <i>J Am Acad Dermatol</i>. 2012;67(4):531–550.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Balch M, Gershenwald JE, Soong SJ, et al.

Adult hematopoiesis occurs in the bone marrow, where hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew and differentiate into progenitor cells, with the latter further developing into mature blood cells (<span class="s1">Figure 94-1</span>). Three key changes occur in the aged hematopoietic system: (1) HSC functional decline, (2) increased clonal hematopoiesis, and (3) myeloid skewing and impaired lymphopoiesis. These changes respectively lead to three well-described manifestations of the dysfunctional hematopoietic system in older adults: the deficiency in stress-induced hematopoiesis, increased incidence of myeloid malignancy, and compromised innate and adaptive immunity. The mechanisms of HSC aging can be intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic changes of the HSC range from DNA damage and epigenetic changes to alteration of proteins and signaling pathways. Cell-extrinsic mechanisms are related to the aging of the microenvironment where HSCs reside. This chapter will focus on the phenotypes and mechanisms of the aged hematopoietic system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#D46B38;display:block;min-height:37.5pt;width:324.0pt;"><p class="s251" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hematology</p></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><div class="textbox" style="background:#ECBC9F;display:block;min-height:37.5pt;width:133.5pt;"><p class="s252" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SECTION F</p></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 94-1. <span class="s5">Model of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and lineage differentiation.

Early in vivo studies in mice showed that marrow donors can repopulate blood cells in serial hematopoietic transplantation experiments spanning multiple lifetimes, prompting the hypothesis that HSCs are “effectively immortal.” Moreover, in patients receiving HSC transplantation, advanced donor age does not place the recipient at an increased risk of delayed engraftment or prolonged cytopenia. However, using competitive transplantation assay, where young and aged HSCs are mixed and transplanted into the same recipient, aged HSCs exhibit a functional decline in their repopulation capacity. Indeed, in a landmark study by Bernitz et al. in 2016 when the authors used in situ genetic labeling, they showed that HSCs can only undergo four self-renewal divisions in their lifetimes before entering a dormancy state, with long-term regenerative potential and differentiation ability lost upon a fifth division. Further studies showed that progenitor cells downstream of HSCs serve as the major self-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">renewing source of day-to-day hematopoiesis, whereas HSCs themselves represent a dormant compartment which can only be called on demand into an active compartment. This is probably why although aged HSCs have multilevel dysfunction, clinically significant anemia and thrombocytopenia only occur in situations of bone marrow stress, such as bleeding, infection, or inflammation. Indeed, an underlying cause of chronic anemia can be found in the majority of older patients, while only a minority of unexplained anemia is likely due to HSC functional decline. In summary, HSC functional decline leads to deficiency in stress-induced hematopoiesis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clonal Hematopoiesis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aging is associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations in HSCs. However, the vast majority of these mutations are silent and have no effect on the phenotype. Rarely, mutations occur at the loci of the leukemia-associated driver genes, conferring a selective growth advantage to the mutated cell. As a result, a substantial proportion of mature blood cells harboring the same mutation are produced—a process known as clonal hematopoiesis. Once the clonal outgrowth reaches a certain threshold, the process is then termed CHIP. Contradictory to its name, CHIP is generally regarded as the “first hit” for malignant transformation, and the presence of CHIP is associated with a 10-fold increased relative risk of myeloid malignancies. In addition, emerging evidence also associates CHIP with nonhematologic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), autoimmune disorders, and death.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), are predominantly diagnosed in older adults and the incidence increases with age. Indeed, the median ages of diagnosis are 65 and 70 years for AML and MDS, respectively. Similarly, the prevalence of CHIP also rises sharply in older adults, reaching 15% in their 70s and 20% in their 90s. The most common mutations associated with CHIP involve <i>DNMT3A, TET2</i>, and <i>ASXL1</i>, which are also commonly found in AML and MDS, further supporting a causal correlation between CHIP and myeloid malignancies. Intriguingly, all three of these genes are key players in epigenetic remodeling of chromatin in HSC, which will be explored later in this chapter.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Myeloid Skewing and Impaired Lymphopoiesis</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aging is associated with immune remodeling and dysfunction, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity, a phenomenon that is known as immunosenescence. The effects of age on adaptive immunity include lymphopenia with declines in B-cells and naïve T-cells, but expansion of inhibitory regulatory (Tregs) and terminally differentiated, senescent T-cells. These cellular imbalances result in impaired responses to immunization and increased susceptibility to new infections; increased rates of autoimmune disorders; and increased risk of reactivation by chronic, latent infections.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Innate immune changes are more complex and less well studied; they involve multiple myeloid cell lines including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The causes of immunosenescence are multifactorial. However, one important association is aging-related myeloid skewing and impaired lymphopoiesis. Single-cell sequencing has revealed that HSCs’ differentiation potential is not homogenous—a subgroup of myeloid- restricted progenitors resides in the young HSC compartment, which expands dramatically with aging, leading to myeloid skewing. However, even though the numbers of myeloid cells are higher, their functions are compromised, leading to impaired innate immunity. Conversely, the number of lymphoid precursors is reduced, resulting in impaired lymphopoiesis and adaptive immunity. Clinically, about a quarter of the older population have lymphopenia at baseline, and lymphopenia itself is an independent risk factor for mortality.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">INTRINSIC MECHANISMS OF HSC AGING</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intrinsic changes of the HSCs on the molecular and phenotypic level have long been identified. Alterations range from DNA damage, metabolic alterations, loss of cell polarity, and impaired autophagy to changes of the intrinsic signaling pathway (<span class="s1">Figure 94-3</span>). Historically, DNA damage was deemed as the driver for HSC aging and responsible for all the phenotypic changes. However, recent studies have shown that epigenetic changes and mitochondrial dysfunction might have played bigger roles in the aged phenotype. Current research is trying to decipher the link between the molecular alterations and the phenotypic changes.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 94-3. <span class="s5">Intrinsic changes of aged HSC comparing to young HSC. Mutations in the DNA accumulate during the aging process, leading to clonal hematopoiesis and predisposing the older adult to myeloid malignancies. Epigenetic drift in the aged HSC affects gene expression including molecules in the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to its noncanonical activation and cell loss of polarity. In the meantime, mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) also accumulate, causing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DNA Damage</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DNA damage is common in mammalian cells and originates from normal cellular activities such as metabolism and DNA replication or external factors such as drug exposure and irradiation. A conserved signaling cascade to prevent accumulation of mutations called DNA damage response (DDR) results in DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, cellular senescence, and cell death. Nevertheless, DNA mutations still accumulate with aging, which are especially pronounced in cells with a long lifespan such as HSCs. Therefore, HSCs rely heavily on the damage-response mechanism to maintain genomic stability. Earlier studies using DDR-deficient mice demonstrated a phenotype of premature aging, raising the concern of defective DNA repair mechanism in aged HSCs. However, recent research found that aged HSCs are as effective as young HSCs in repairing DNA. While HSCs possess an effective DNA repair mechanism throughout the aging process, point mutations in epigenetic regulators can still occur leading to clonal hematopoiesis and predisposing older adults to myeloid malignancies.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Historically, DNA damage in HSCs is deemed as the driver for both HSC functional decline and myeloid malignancies in older people. However, the former notion has been challenged in recent years as the function of aged HSCs could be restored by a variety of rejuvenation methods. For example,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aged HSCs can be reversed to young phenotypes through induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation and redifferentiation, which would be impossible if dysfunction originates from the genomic level. On the other hand, although DNA damage and CHIP predispose the older adult to myeloid malignancies, the majority of CHIP does not evolve into MDS and AML, and not all myeloid malignancies have CHIP-associated gene mutations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Therefore, DNA damage and CHIP is only one of the many mechanisms leading to myeloid malignancies and may only partially explain HSC functional decline with aging.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epigenetic Drift</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Young and aged HSCs have a drastically different gene expression pattern. For example, aged HSCs have augmented platelet gene expression at the expense of lymphopoietic genes, leading to the myeloid skewing feature of aged HSCs. Such genome-wide transcriptional differences can only occur at the epigenetic level, which includes DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin architecture. Epigenetic mechanisms encompass chromatin- based regulation of gene expression without altering the DNA sequence.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These pathways are more dynamic and responsive to the environment and stress disease can serve as a form of cellular memory to previous insults. Given that the phenotype of the aged hematopoietic system can be reversed by iPSC generation and redifferentiation, it is likely that most aging- associated changes are not at the durable genetic code but originate from the epigenetic level.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">DNA methylation is an epigenetic signaling mechanism via covalent modification of cytosine moieties by a class of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) to produce 5-methylcytosine (5mC). These modifications are highly restricted to cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) dinucleotides and are traditionally viewed as a repressive signal, which is associated with transcriptional inactivation of nearby promoter sequences. Intriguingly, the most common single nucleotide mutation found in aging HSCs is the transition from C to T at CpG dinucleotides. Spontaneous deamination of cytosine results in uracil, which is recognized as an error and converted back to cytosine by DNA repair. However, 5mC deamination yields thymine, which can surpass DNA repair and results in a CpG to TpG mutation. Given that CpGs are highly methylated, this transition suggests an interplay between epigenetic regulation and DNA mutations throughout aging.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although global hypomethylation occurs in most somatic cells during aging, aged HSCs demonstrate local hyper- and hypomethylation, indicating a pattern of differential gene expression. Indeed, such alterations in CpG methylation patterns can be modeled to accurately predict chronological age in healthy people and identify apparent discrepancies between chronological and biological age in conditions that have been associated with accelerated aging, including Down syndrome and chronic HIV infection. Furthermore, such modeling also predicted increased mortality in persons with age-related comorbidities.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The mechanism of dysregulation of DNA methylation in aged HSCs is still under investigation. However, DNA mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as <i>DNMT3A, TET2</i>, and <i>ASXL1</i>, can only lead to clonal hematopoiesis and myeloid skewing without the phenotypic changes seen in aged HSCs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Considering DNA methylation being the terminal step of signaling pathways, it is likely that the cause of epigenetic drift comes from outside in (environmental changes leading to epigenetic drift), rather than inside out (DNA damage leading to epigenetic drift).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Histone modification is an additional layer of epigenetic signaling that dictates the availability of specific gene loci to regulatory proteins. The N- terminal tail of histones serve as a robust platform for a myriad of modifications, which in concert lead to transcriptional activation or repression. Various histone code writers, readers, and erasers have been identified but the diversity of these modifications and permutations, especially in the context of neoplasia and senescence, have made clinical interpretation challenging. Nevertheless, both local and global changes in histone modifications have been reported in the aging bone marrow. For example, histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 experiences significant functional loss during aging, leading to decreased H3K9me3 level in HSCs. Accumulation of these changes within the histone code provides a dynamic epigenetic landscape for sophisticated gene regulation superimposed on the static DNA code.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Loss of Mitochondrial Homeostasis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Loss of mitochondrial homeostasis is an important mechanism for HSC aging. Just like genomic DNA, mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) also accumulate during aging. Indeed, in murine models using the proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase, premature aging phenotypes</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">were observed. However, it is still unclear as to whether mtDNA mutations directly lead to aging. Nonetheless, it is well known that accumulations of mtDNA mutations increase with age and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">HSCs reside in the relatively hypoxic bone marrow niches because they are exquisitely sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The oxidative stress imposed by ROS can lead to DNA structural modification and impaired HSC function. Not surprisingly, aging is associated with incremental levels of ROS. As mitochondria is a major source of ROS production, young HSCs have a significantly lower number of mitochondria. Therefore, oxidative stress is an important cause of HSC dysfunction during the aging process.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changes of Intrinsic Signaling Pathways</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Signaling pathways are bridges connecting extracellular stimuli and intracellular response. However, intrinsically altered expression of signaling molecules could also lead to aberrant cellular response, conferring the cells the aging phenotypes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The Wnt5a-Cdc42 axis is one of the most well identified pathways in HSC aging. The Wnt pathway is a highly conserved pathway across animal species; it regulates gene transcription, cytoskeleton shaping, and calcium homeostasis. Intrinsically increased Wnt5a expression, possibly secondary to epigenetic drift, leading to the activation of Cdc42, a known regulator of cytoskeleton, results in the loss of cellular polarity along with other aging phenotypes. Moreover, genetically modified mice lacking Wnt5a have attenuated aging, and Cdc42 inhibitor CASIN is able to reverse the aging phenotypes in aged HSCs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Tse’s group found a small acidic protein AF1q, originally discovered in patients with AML with chromosomal abnormality t(1;11) (q21;q23), is a critical cofactor in the Wnt signaling pathway. The expression of AF1q is bimodal—significantly upregulated AF1q expression is seen in the early and aged HSC compartment. Activation of AF1q simultaneously enhances multiple signaling pathways closely related to HSC aging, including the Notch pathway and the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3k)/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway. AF1q boosts Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 specifically through activation of the signaling of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) with resultant enhanced PDGF-BB expression. The imbalance of PI3k/Akt signaling is associated with aging in various tissues. Taken</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">together, it is hypothesized that AF1q is involved in the aging process through enhanced Akt phosphorylation via PDGFR activation by AF1q-induced PDGF-BB. In addition, the Cdc42-binding protein, SPEC1, shares the same bidirectional transcriptional promoter as AF1q. Therefore, it is also possible that one of the important mechanisms of HSC aging is associated with the switch of the transcriptional direction of the bidirectional promoter (<span class="s1">Figure 94-4</span>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">FIGURE 94-4. <span class="s5">Illustration of the bidirectional promoter. A bidirectional promoter regulates AF1q and SPEC1, which are actively involved in Wnt and Cdc42 signaling pathways for the hematopoietic stem cell aging process.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EXTRINSIC MECHANISMS OF HSC AGING</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1978, Schofield first proposed the “niche” concept to describe the microenvironment that maintains and regulates HSCs. In recent years, a growing body of evidence is supporting the hypothesis that HSC aging is not only an autonomous process, but also influenced by the functional changes of the HSC niches. Upon aging, alterations such as imbalanced mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) differentiation and adrenergic signaling remodeling coordinately regulate the fate of HSCs, leading to myeloid skewing and impaired lymphopoiesis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Bone Marrow Niches</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During embryonic development, the arteries are responsible for the emergence of HSCs. Similarly, the bone marrow niches for HSCs are also located in the perivascular regions. The bone marrow space is uniformly occupied by sinusoids. However, the peri-endosteal region is highly vascularized by arterioles, which ultimately connect with sinusoids through arterial capillaries. Therefore, the bone marrow consists of two functionally distinct niches, the arteriolar and the sinusoidal niches (<span class="s1">Figure 94-5</span>). The arteriolar niche is in the periendosteal region; dormant HSCs are predominantly found in this region, where lymphopoiesis preferentially occurs. On the contrary, the sinusoidal niche is highly innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers and contains less quiescent HSCs; myelopoiesis mostly takes place in this region.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 94-5. <span class="s5">HSC niches in bone marrow. Two distinct perivascular niches, the arteriole niche and the sinusoidal niche, exist in the bone marrow. The arteriole niche contains dormant HSCs where lymphopoiesis preferentially occurs. The sinusoidal niche is highly innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers and contains less quiescent HSCs, and myelopoiesis mostly takes place in this region. HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Location Shift Between Niches During Aging</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HSCs redistribute within the bone marrow niches upon aging. It has been well recognized that aged HSCs locate further away from the bone surface than young HSCs. This represents the migration of aged HSCs from the periendosteal arteriolar niche where they remain quiescent, to the sinusoidal</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">niche where they become active in myelopoiesis. Therefore, the aging- related redistribution of HSCs contributes to the impaired lymphopoiesis in older adults.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Dysfunction</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cellular components of bone marrow niches consist of endothelial cells, osteoblasts, adipocytes, neuro-glial cells, as well as MSCs. MSCs are multipotent precursors that can differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes to support HSCs within the niches; they can also secrete inhibitory cytokines and chemokines to help maintain HSCs in the quiescent state. Similar to HSCs, MSCs also experience aging-related dysfunctional changes, such as DNA damage, telomere shortening, elevated ROS, and cell- signaling alterations. These changes lead to impaired osteoblasts differentiation and increased adipogenesis, which are responsible for the increased fat tissues in the bone marrow among the older people.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sympathetic Nervous System Remodeling</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The bone marrow niche is heavily innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. The release of adrenergic neurotransmitter provides a stress signal to the bone marrow, regulating the functions and mobilization of HSCs. In fact, the sympathetic activity is universally elevated in older adults, manifesting as an increased concentration of noradrenaline in the plasma. In the bone marrow, the aging-dependent increase of sympathetic activity can cause myeloid skewing of aging HSCs through activation of a specific type of β- adrenergic receptor.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Immunosenescence, Inflammaging, and Extrinsic Signaling Pathway Changes <span style=" color: #000;">Normal aging is associated with systemic, chronic inflammation known as inflammaging. Characterized by low-grade and persistent inflammation in response to physical, chemical, or metabolic noxious stimuli, inflammaging also may develop in response to chronic infections including cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. These inflammatory responses may damage tissues and organs over time, and contribute to the emergence of multiple comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, while also contributing to hematopoietic dysfunction.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The mechanisms of inflammaging are diverse and incompletely understood but may include the expansion of immunosenescent populations of helper (CD4+) and effector (CD8+) T-cells. These cells are characterized by telomere shortening and a reduced capacity to proliferate, defective mitochondrial function, and increased ROS formation; in addition, they activate proinflammatory pathways including p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Telomeres are repeating hexameric sequences of nucleotides that protect against DNA damage. Located at the ends of chromosomes, telomeres shorten with each replicative cycle, but may be partially restored by enzymatic telomerase activity. DNA damage ensues when telomere shortening exceeds a critical threshold, at which time cells lose their ability to replicate. Senescent T-cells exhibit shortened telomeres with reduced telomerase activity, and they lose their surface expression of CD27 and CD28. CD8+/CD28− cells that reexpress CD45RA (T<span class="s253">EMRA</span>) identify a subset of terminally differentiated immunosenescent memory CD8+ T-cells that more specifically associate with age-related adverse clinical outcomes. For example, Alzheimer disease patients have decreased percentages of naïve T-cells, elevated memory cells, and expansion CD28− CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations, particularly including CD45RA (T<span class="s253">EMRA</span>) cells, compared to healthy young or older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In the hematopoietic system, interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces HSC myeloid skewing and IL-6 promotes thrombopoiesis leading to thrombosis. These cytokines exert their functions through extrinsic signaling pathways. Among them, the NF-κB pathway is involved in the cellular response of a variety of cytokines. Constitutive NF-κB activation in older people, possibly due to inflammaging, leads to hyperproliferation of HSCs with resultant exacerbated myelopoiesis and increased myeloproliferative disorders.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANEMIA IN THE OLDER ADULT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Burden of Anemia in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anemia, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL in men and less than 12 g/dL in women, becomes more common as people age. More than 10% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older have anemia, and the prevalence grows above 20% in those 85 years or older. Although usually mild, anemia in older adults is associated</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with a significant increase in mortality and morbidity, such as decreased physical performance, increased falls, impaired cognition, restricted quality of life, and more frequent hospitalization. One would argue if a lower limit of normal hemoglobin should be proposed for older adults. However, large surveillance databases (eg, the NHANES-III database and the Scripps- Kaiser database) have shown that when excluding patients with iron deficiency anemia, elevated creatinine, and elevated ESR or CRP, the mean hemoglobin remains unchanged across different age groups regardless of gender or race. This indicates that although anemia is more common in older adults, the majority is associated with an underlying cause, such as iron deficiency or chronic inflammation. Indeed, as mentioned above, most aged HSCs remain dormant, and can only turn into active states under demand or stress. Therefore, aging is associated with defective stress-induced hematopoiesis, which would not be apparent under normal situations.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Causes of Anemia in the Older Adult</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The prevalence of different causes of anemia varies in different studies. Nevertheless, the major causes of anemia include iron deficiency anemia (12%–20%), anemia of chronic inflammation (6%–20%), chronic kidney disease (4%–8%), folate or vitamin B<span class="s11">12</span> deficiency (0%–14%), MDS (9%–</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16%), or malignant hematologic disorder (0%–2%). If none of the above causes can be found, the anemia is defined as unexplained anemia of the elderly (UAE), which ranges from 34% to 44% in different studies. It has been questioned whether UAE represents a real entity or is just the result of an unidentified underlying cause. Indeed, smaller studies with more extensive work-up find a significant portion of UAE is due to insufficient erythropoietin (EPO) production without impaired excretory renal function or chronic kidney disease. To date, the cause of insufficient EPO production older adults is yet to be discovered. Recently, there has been increasing enthusiasm to study the correlation between clonal hematopoiesis and anemia. However, although clonal hematopoiesis is more frequently detected in individuals with anemia, the relative difference is small between anemic people and controls, suggesting that the mutations do not account for the majority of UAE. Lastly, UAE may occur after an unidentified bone marrow stress, and anemia develops as a result of aging-related impaired stress- induced hematopoiesis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation of Anemia</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Initial work-up for anemia in older adults includes a complete blood count with differential, reticulocyte count, ferritin, iron studies, creatinine, vitamin B<span class="s11">12</span>, red blood cell folate, thyroid function test, and liver function test. These</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tests help clinicians rule out the most common causes of anemia, including iron deficiency, nutritional deficiency, and chronic kidney disease. If the above tests are nonrevealing, further work-ups such as EPO level, copper, zinc, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, and serum electrophoresis could be pursued to rule out more rare causes. At last, if a hematological malignancy is suspected, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are mandatory to exclude disorders such as MDS or leukemia.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management of Anemia in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment for anemia should be “age-adjusted” with recognition of potential side effects and impact on the quality of life. For frail patients, even a weekly clinic visit for injection could be burdensome and significantly affect their quality of life.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In patients with iron deficiency anemia, oral iron substitution would be sufficient in most cases. However, the efficacy of daily dosing of oral iron has been questioned as iron supplements increase hepcidin level for up to 24 hours and are associated with lower iron absorption on the following day.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thus, every-other-day dosing of oral iron is generally preferred over daily dosing. In situations when oral iron does not ameliorate anemia or the patient does not tolerate oral iron, intravenous iron is an effective alternative.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Different formulations of intravenous iron exist, such as iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, and ferric carboxymaltose, which are all generally well tolerated.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are analogs of EPO and widely used in end-stage renal disease–related anemia and patients with MDS with moderate to severe anemia. Data on application of ESAs in other causes of anemia including UAE are limited.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Blood transfusion is the most effective treatment for acute symptomatic anemia. For the transfusion threshold, we generally use the cutoff hemoglobin level recommended by the AABB—7 g/dL for the general population and 8 g/dL for patients with symptoms of end-organ ischemia. However, older anemic patients should always be transfused with the recognition of comorbidities. Transfusion threshold and frequency may differ based on many factors and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. For example,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in a patient with chronic hemolytic anemia who is otherwise asymptomatic from a baseline hemoglobin of 6 g/dL, aiming a higher hemoglobin goal of 7 g/dL would only increase the frequency of transfusion without improving quality of life.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CONCLUSION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clearly, there are biological features and properties that distinguish young and aged HSCs (<span class="s1">Table 94-1</span>). These differences provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, especially the increased risk of immunologic, hematologic, myelodysplastic, and HSC-proliferative disorders that so frequently accompany aging. Furthermore, aging affects not only the cellular or the HSC compartment, but also the bone marrow microenvironment. With improved understanding of the fundamental molecular events contributing to these pathogenic changes, there have been prospects to develop mechanism-based therapeutic interventions to preserve and maintain normal hematopoiesis. This may provide opportunities to prevent these diseases and further identify, in a more rational manner, novel therapeutic approaches in treating these disorders in older adults.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 94-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>PROPERTIES OF YOUNG AND AGED HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS (HSCS)</p></div></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">Barbe-Tuana F, Funchal G, Schmitz CRR, Maurmann RM, Bauer ME.

Symptoms, treatments, and natural history vary widely.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hematologic malignancies include myeloid malignancies (ie, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders) and lymphoid malignancies (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, and plasma cell neoplasms). Older adults make up a large proportion of incident and prevalent cases of these diseases as well as those dying from these conditions. As the population ages, the burden of these diseases will rise affecting older adults disproportionately.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The effectiveness of treatments has improved substantially over recent decades for most hematologic malignancies. Unfortunately, the response rates and cure rates for older patients have lagged behind for a number of reasons, including in some cases: more resistant tumor biology, presence of multiple chronic conditions, and functional impairments that decrease treatment tolerance. Underrepresentation of older adults in clinical trials remains a limitation. With the increased focus on clinical trials designed specifically for older adults and the ongoing development of less toxic, targeted therapies, opportunities for effective treatment of older adults with hematologic malignancies continue to improve.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral blood cytopenias. In these diseases, cells of the affected lineage are unable to undergo maturation and differentiation, resulting in cytopenias. MDS can be indolent or progress rapidly to bone marrow failure. The major clinical significance of these disorders is the morbidity associated with profound cytopenias and the potential to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDS is associated with impaired quality of life and high health care utilization with an estimated 3-year survival rate of 45%. Approximately 15,000 to 20,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the United States, and about 80% of these are among adults older than age 70.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><ul id="l13"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Recognize presentation, workup, and management of common hematologic malignancies in older adults.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Recognize the value of geriatric assessment to personalize care for older adults with hematologic malignancies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><ol id="l14"><li data-list-text="1."><h3 style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Older adults make up a large proportion of incident and prevalent hematologic disorders, as well as those dying from these conditions.</h3></li><li data-list-text="2."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">The response rates and cure rates for older patients with hematologic disorders have lagged behind those of young adults for a number of reasons: more resistant tumor biology, presence of multiple chronic conditions, and functional impairments that decrease treatment tolerance.

The diagnosis should be suspected in older individuals presenting with cytopenia. In clinical studies, the majority of patients have a hemoglobin of less than 11, platelet count less than 100,000, and an absolute neutrophil count less than 1000 at the time of diagnosis. However, careful attention should be paid to consistent decreases in blood counts over time in an older adult, which may signify early developing MDS. A frequent presentation is progressive macrocytic anemia in an older adult followed by developing pancytopenia. Many patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, careful history-taking should include questions regarding recurrent infections, bruising, and bleeding. The differential diagnosis for suspected MDS includes AML, aplastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia (B<span class="s11">12</span> and folate</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">deficiency), copper deficiency, viral infections (HIV), large granular lymphocytic leukemia, and heavy metal poisoning.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The initial serologic work-up includes a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, RBC folate, serum B<span class="s11">12</span>, iron studies, and review of the peripheral smear. Classic peripheral blood findings associated</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">with MDS include macrocytosis and hypogranular, hypolobated (dysplastic)</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">neutrophils. A bone marrow biopsy with cytogenetic analysis is required to confirm the diagnosis. The bone marrow is typically hypercellular and demonstrates evidence of dysplasia. Cytogenetic abnormalities play a critical role in the diagnosis and natural history of MDS. Common cytogenetic abnormalities involve chromosomes 5, 7, 8, 17, or 20.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk Stratification</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme incorporates evolving knowledge of the biology of disease including the significance of cytogenetic abnormalities and highlights the heterogeneity of MDS. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was developed to risk stratify patients at the time of diagnosis based on cytogenetic, morphologic, and clinical data. The IPSS for MDS was derived from an analysis of 816</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">patients, 75% of whom were older than 60 years. The IPSS incorporates specific cytogenetic abnormalities, the percentage of marrow blasts in the bone marrow, and the number of hematopoietic lineages involved in the cytopenia. Risk scores are determined based on these variables, and a categorization of low risk, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high risk is assigned. These categories can differentiate patients with median survival of more than 5 years at diagnosis (low risk) from those with less than 1-year survival (high risk). Another risk stratification system proposed by the WHO includes additional variables shown to add prognostic information including multilineage dysplasia, severe anemia, or transfusion dependency. This system can be used both at diagnosis and after progression to predict survival. A five-category revised IPSS was developed using over 7000 patients (median age 71) that differs by further subdividing cytogenetic abnormalities and increasing the weight of higher blast percentages. In the development cohort, age was a prognostic factor for survival but not for progression to AML, having more impact in lower- versus higher-risk disease. The revised IPSS is commonly used and represented in <span class="s1">Tables 95-1 </span>and <span class="s1">95-2</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>REVISED INTERNATIONAL PROGNOSTIC SCORING SYSTEM (IPSS) FOR MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>OVERALL SURVIVAL AND RISK OF AML EVOLUTION BY REVISED IPSS SCORE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Selection of treatment for patients with MDS depends not only on disease risk stratification but on assessment of a patient’s overall fitness and competing comorbid conditions. Most patients with MDS have additional comorbidity, and higher comorbidity burden has been associated with shorter survival independent of age or disease risk. A prospective study investigating the predictive utility of a geriatric assessment among older adults treated nonintensively for MDS (<i>N </i>= 51) and AML (<i>N </i>= 69) found that requiring assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and high fatigue rating were independently associated with shorter survival. Another study showed that requiring assistance with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), impaired cognition, or mobility limitation were associated with higher likelihood to discontinue therapy early. Studies evaluating strategies for assessing frailty among MDS patients are presented in <span class="s1">Table 95-3</span>. Use of geriatric assessment and frailty screening can assist in treatment decision- making and guide supportive care.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>FRAILTY MEASURES FOR MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment strategies emphasize targeting higher-risk MDS and subgroups defined by specific cytogenetic abnormalities. Current treatment recommendations involve a risk-adapted therapeutic approach (outlined in <span class="s1">Table 95-4</span>). Supportive care, aimed at controlling symptoms related to cytopenias, is indicated for all patients and is the mainstay of treatment for lower-risk patients or frail patients. Supportive care often includes red cell and platelet transfusions and antibiotics for infection. Hematopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin are used to try to minimize transfusion requirements in responding patients. Those most likely to benefit have lower risk IPSS-R scores, serum erythropoietin level less than 500 mU/mL, low transfusion requirement, and shorter interval between diagnosis and treatment. A subcutaneously administered recombinant fusion protein targeting Smad2/3 signaling, luspatercept-aamt, decreased transfusion requirements for patients with low-/intermediate-risk MDS with ringed sideroblasts that failed to respond to erythropoiesis stimulating agents. Many MDS patients are also at risk for iron overload due to transfusion dependence. Iron chelation therapy should be initiated for those with lower- risk MDS, ongoing transfusion dependence, and expected survival greater than 1 year.</p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-4 <span class="s3">■ </span>TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH MDS BASED ON DISEASE AND PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients in the higher-risk IPSS categories are more likely to experience morbidity related to cytopenias and to progress to acute leukemia in a shorter time interval from diagnosis. Hypomethylating agents which inhibit DNA methyltransferases (azacitidine and decitabine) represent the mainstay of treatment for most patients. Randomized studies with azacitidine compared to placebo have shown improvements in survival, quality of life, and a longer time to progression to acute leukemia, in patients with MDS. A survival advantage exists even for those greater than 75 years. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved decitabine for the treatment of higher- risk MDS. Decitabine decreases transfusion requirements and symptoms although has not shown a definitive survival benefit in randomized trials. A challenge for older adults using hypomethylating agents is myelosuppression which often worsens for several months before response is detectable. The duration of treatment can be challenging as well with most clinical trials treating for more than 6 months for all patients and more than 12 months for responders.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with the 5q– syndrome, defined by a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 as the sole abnormality, tend to present with refractory, severe</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">anemia, and a relatively normal platelet count. It is considered a more favorable MDS subset because a large percentage of patients do not progress to acute leukemia. Lenalidomide, an oral immunomodulatory drug, significantly decreases transfusion requirements and demonstrates reversal of cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with 5q– syndrome, which may translate into improved quality of life. The primary toxicity is myelosuppression which can result in dose reductions and dose delays.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Careful attention to dosing is required with adjustments needed for mild impairment in renal function which is common among older adults. This drug is a standard of care treatment for transfusion-dependent patients with 5q– syndrome and reinforces the clinical and therapeutic importance of cytogenetic evaluation in MDS. Studies suggest it also has efficacy in patients with low-risk MDS without 5q deletion and may be considered for these patients as well if they are transfusion dependent.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Higher-intensity therapy such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation, to date the only curative therapy for MDS, is generally restricted to younger adults with acceptable donors because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with therapy. However, with use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (RIC), stem cell transplantation is considered for selected adults between ages 60 to 80 with good functional status and minimal comorbidity. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can result in appreciable survival rates among patients with high-risk disease. However, most older adults in this context are age less than 70 with minimal data for those greater than 75. The real-world applicability of transplantation for most older adults with high-risk MDS will require refined definitions of “fitness” and collection of outcomes such as quality of life, functional independence, and health care utilization to inform treatment decisions. Evidence supports the use of geriatric assessment to identify vulnerabilities that increase morbidity associated with transplant (functional dependence and cognitive impairment) and to inform supportive care optimization to enhance resilience.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AML refers to a group of clonal hematopoietic disorders that are characterized by proliferation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow. Accumulation of leukemic cells impairs the normal hematopoietic function of the bone marrow, resulting in cytopenias with or without leukocytosis.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">AML is a disease of older adults, with a median age at diagnosis between 68 and 72; approximately one-third are greater than or equal to 75 years. Risk factors for the development of AML include a history of preceding MDS, exposure to certain chemotherapy drugs (alkylating agents, topoisomerase 2 inhibitors, and nitrosoureas), radiation or benzene exposure, and a history of Down syndrome. The majority of diagnosed cases of AML, however, are not linked to any known risk factor.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The clinical signs and symptoms of AML can be varied and nonspecific.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients usually present with evidence of bone marrow failure: anemia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia. Fatigue, dyspnea, bleeding, fever, and infection are common upon presentation. Leukemic infiltration of tissues outside the bone marrow such as liver, spleen, skin, lymph nodes, and central nervous system (CNS) can produce a variety of other symptoms specific to the site of involvement. Some patients present with severe leukocytosis, which can produce symptoms of leukostasis as a result of a large blast fraction in the peripheral blood. Peripheral blood findings range from pancytopenia with or without circulating blasts cells to severe leukocytosis with circulating blasts typically with anemia and thrombocytopenia.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis of AML depends primarily on detection of leukemic blasts of myeloid lineage (≥ 20%) in the bone marrow. Morphologic evaluation can be aided by immunohistochemical and flow cytometry techniques to confirm myeloid versus lymphoid origin. The WHO classification of AML incorporates morphologic, immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical features. Identification of genetic and molecular abnormalities have highlighted the heterogeneity of AML and identified subsets associated with better or worse prognosis. For example, the core binding factor leukemias [inv 16, t(8;21), t(16;16)] and acute promyelocytic leukemia [t(15;17)] are associated with better prognosis. The presence of mutations in <i>FLT-3 </i>in tumors with normal karyotype is associated with worse overall survival. Risk-adapted treatment strategies have been developed to maximize clinical outcomes and minimize toxicity based on cytogenetic classification. In addition, molecular abnormalities are increasingly identified as treatment targets.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="p">If untreated or unresponsive to chemotherapy, AML may be rapidly fatal (median survival &lt; 2 months). The major causes of death are overwhelming infection and hemorrhage related to the disease-associated cytopenias. AML is one of the most dramatic examples of age-related outcome disparity in oncology (</span>Figures 95-1 <span style=" color: #000;">and </span>95-2<span class="p">). In general, older adults (commonly defined as age ≥ 60) experience higher morbidity and mortality rates with treatment compared with those younger than 60 years. Concerns regarding the efficacy and toxicity of therapies have resulted in a large proportion of older adults in the United States receiving no therapy for the disease. However, it is clear from both clinical trial and population-based data that chemotherapy can provide a survival benefit over supportive care for many older adults.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 95-1. <span class="s5">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) SEER survival rates by time since diagnosis, 2000–2017.

The biology of AML differs among older adults compared to younger patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities are the most important prognostic factor in AML. As a group, older patients with AML have a higher percentage of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities and a lower percentage of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities compared to younger patients. Unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with decreased rates of remission and shortened overall survival. In addition, expression of MDR1, which confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, is more common in older AML patients. Older patients are more likely to have a secondary AML arising from underlying MDS, which is less responsive to standard therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, age-related changes in the bone marrow microenvironment influence outcomes for older adults. Overall, AML in older patients is more resistant</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to available therapies, resulting in lower remission rates and higher chance of relapse after achieving remission. In addition, patient-factors such as comorbidity and functional limitations influence treatment tolerance. While older age (particularly &gt; 75 years) is consistently associated with worse outcomes, treatment toxicity and benefit are inadequately predicted by age alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For nonacute promyelocytic AML, treatment strategies include intensive therapy, less intensive therapy, or best supportive care (BSC). Randomized studies have shown consistent survival advantage for antileukemic therapy over BSC. Currently BSC alone should be considered for the minority of older adults who have pre-existing frailty, limited non-AML life expectancy, or express a preference to forgo therapy in favor of hospice after informed discussion. Treatment at specialized leukemia centers should be prioritized when possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In general, intensive induction chemotherapy (inclusive of anthracycline and cytarabine) is recommended for those older adults with minimal comorbidity and good functional status who also have favorable or intermediate risk disease. For those patients with <i>FLT3 </i>mutated AML, the multitargeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin should be added given the survival advantage seen in the pivotal trial despite the lack of inclusion of older adults. The goal of treatment is to achieve remission and proceed to tailored post-remission therapy to render long-term disease-free survivorship.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another advance for older adults is the availability of CPX-351, a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin, which improved survival for older adults (aged 60–75) with secondary AML (ie, therapy- related, antecedent MDS), a group with historically poor outcomes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Many older adults may not be considered “fit” for treatment with intensive chemotherapy or may prefer an alternate approach. Single-agent DNA hypomethylating agents (eg, azacitidine and decitabine) and low-dose cytarabine have both been shown to improve outcomes compared to BSC. Recently, the addition of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax to azacitidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine has become a standard of care option with improved remission rates and survival compared to single-agent therapy. In the registration trial, which defined “unfit” for intensive therapy by age greater than or equal to 75 or 60 to 74 years with comorbidity (ie, congestive heart failure, creatinine clearance 30–45 mL/min, pulmonary disease, or other comorbidity per physician judgement), the median overall</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">survival improved from 10 to 15 months. Side effects of cytopenias and infections were more common on the combination arm.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients who achieve remission should be evaluated for post-remission therapy in an attempt to prevent or delay relapse. Optimal post-remission therapy in older patients remains poorly defined. Oral azacitidine maintenance provides a survival advantage for patients who are not candidates for allogeneic transplantation. An increasing number of older adults who achieve remission are being referred for reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation in an effort to improve longer-term disease-free survival and cure rates.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Geriatric assessment can be feasibly performed in the setting of AML therapy and it adds information to standard clinical assessment. For example, in a prospective study of adults age greater than or equal to 60 who received intensive therapy, pretreatment geriatric assessment detected significant impairments: cognitive impairment, 24%; depression, 26%; distress, 50%; ADL impairment, 34%; impaired physical performance, 31%; and comorbidity, 40%. Importantly, most patients on study were impaired in one (92.6%) or more (63%) measured characteristics. Impaired cognition (modified Mini Mental Status Examination &lt; 77) and physical performance (short physical performance battery &lt; 9) were independently associated with worse survival. Geriatric assessment measures including dependence in ADLs and higher comorbidity burden have also been predictive of survival among older adults receiving lesser intensive therapy. Similarly, a role for geriatric assessment is emerging to identify older adults who may tolerate allogenic transplantation as post-remission therapy. Understanding specific patient vulnerabilities is imperative to help to predict tolerance to standard therapies and identify targets for intervention to improve treatment tolerance.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Treatment recommendations differ for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). APL is characterized by a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 leading to the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene with the retinoic acid receptor α (<i>RARα</i>) gene, resulting in disruption of normal cell differentiation. While less common among older adults, this disease has a very high response and cure rate with current therapies that include use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which overcomes the differentiation block. A unique clinical feature of APL is presentation with bleeding secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation and requires emergent treatment. Hemorrhage is a frequent cause</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of early mortality, particularly if untreated. When suspected, treatment with ATRA should begin immediately. Curative treatment includes induction with ATRA with either arsenic trioxide (ATO) for patients with WBC less than or equal to 10,000/μL, or plus an anthracycline for patients with WBC greater than 10,000/μL. Induction therapy is followed by consolidation with ATRA plus ATO-based therapy, with remission and disease-free survival rates of approximately 90%. In addition, relapsed patients may respond to ATO, with a high proportion achieving a second remission. This subtype of AML should be treated aggressively in older adults given the high probability of response. Effective non-chemotherapy regimens extend therapeutic options to the extremes of age and for vulnerable and frail older adults.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by excess production of mature granulocytes that eventually progresses to a clinical picture similar to acute leukemia with an overgrowth of immature cells (blast crisis). CML is associated with the fusion of two genes: <i>BCR </i>(on chromosome 22) and <i>ALB1 </i>(on chromosome 9). It accounts for a little over 10% of all leukemias. The incidence increases with age, and the average age at diagnosis is approximately 65 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis is suspected by the demonstration of granulocytosis in the peripheral blood with a predominance of segmented neutrophils and myelocytes, increased basophils and eosinophils, and increased bone marrow cellularity. The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) and/or its products (<i>BCR/ABL </i>fusion mRNA, Bcr/Abl protein) are required to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis can be made on peripheral blood using PCR or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. Bone marrow biopsy is still required for complete cytogenetic evaluation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The disease characteristically proceeds through three phases: chronic (present in ~ 85% at diagnosis), accelerated, and terminal (blastic) phase (<span class="s1">Table 95-5</span>). The length of the chronic phase is highly variable. In the chronic phase, the disease is easily controlled without aggressive therapy. Many patients are asymptomatic (diagnosis prompted by leukocytosis), common symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal fullness or pain related to splenomegaly. The accelerated phase begins with gradual increases in white cells, platelets, and spleen size. Initially good maturation</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">persists, but eventually more blasts are seen in the peripheral blood. The terminal phase of the disease is indistinguishable from acute leukemia. The blasts have myeloid surface markers in 85% of the patients and lymphoid markers in the remaining 15%.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA CLASSIFICATION</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Treatment for CML has changed dramatically in the past decades, altering the natural history of this disease. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI-571), a targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), designed specifically for the treatment of CML (in oral formulation), proved to have significant activity in the blast phase and accelerated phase of CML. In chronic phase CML, imatinib mesylate yielded marked improvements in clinical and cytogenetic responses, rates of disease progression, and treatment-related toxicity compared to previously used IFN-α plus low-dose ara-C in a randomized clinical trial. Based on these results, imatinib mesylate replaced interferon regimens as the standard of care for patients with chronic phase CML. Imatinib is very well tolerated, which is particularly relevant for the older adult population. Responses are durable with many patients maintaining response now after well over a decade of therapy. More potent, second- generation, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) produce more rapid and better responses than imatinib in first-line treatment although no difference in overall survival has been demonstrated to date.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These drugs are also active in patients who have progressed on imatinib providing sequential treatment options prior to consideration of cytotoxic therapy. Adherence to daily administration is critical for successful treatment of CML with careful monitoring of response to determine when other therapies should be considered. PCR techniques provide a highly sensitive and reliable method to monitor response to treatments. Long-term follow-up data from imatinib clinical trials show that cytogenetic and molecular</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">responses are durable and there are low rates of cumulative or late toxic effects. Choice if first line therapy for CML for older adults is informed by concurrent comorbid conditions such as heart failure, risk of cardiotoxicity, QT prolongation, and thrombosis. Imatinib has the longest term safety data and remains an appealing standard for many older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the chronic phase remains a consideration for curative treatment for younger patients, primarily those with suboptimal response to TKIs. It has minimal role in older patients because of the morbidity and mortality of this treatment and availability of therapies to control disease. TKIs should be the initial treatment for both the accelerated and blastic phases of CML if not already used during the chronic phase of the disease although responses are often short lived. Treatment of the blastic transformation (after TKI therapy) depends on the cell origin of the blasts. Myeloid blastic states respond poorly to standard AML therapies, and no standard therapy is available. Lymphoid blastic states can be controlled for 6 to 12 months, with standard combination regimens as used for de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western Hemisphere and may be commonly encountered in a geriatric practice. CLL is a disorder of clonal proliferation of mature lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid organs. CLL occurs predominantly in older adults, with median age at diagnosis of approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">70. About 21,250 new cases were estimated in the United States for 2021 by the American Cancer Society. This may be an underestimate because many patients are asymptomatic for years. There is no racial difference in the United States, and a slight male predominance. Current diagnostic studies, especially immunophenotyping, allow for differentiation of the chronic lymphoid malignancies: B-cell CLL, T-cell CLL, prolymphocytic, circulating non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and hairy cell leukemia.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">B-Cell CLL</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">B-cell CLL accounts for over 95% of all CLL. Approximately 25% of such patients are identified with asymptomatic lymphocytosis during evaluation for other medical problems. Symptomatic patients may present with weight loss, fatigue, recurrent infections, fevers, or pain associated with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hepatosplenomegaly or bulky lymphadenopathy. In most patients, the disease has a gradual progression spanning several years and the extent of the lymphoid burden at diagnosis correlates well with length of preexisting disease. In some patients, the disease has a more aggressive course, and progression to advanced clinical stages may occur within a few months of diagnosis. Identification of molecular and protein markers are beginning to explain the heterogenous natural history observed in this disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis of CLL requires presence of monoclonal B lymphocytes greater than or equal to 5 × 10<span class="s22">9</span>/L with a specific immunophenotyping pattern (coexpression of CD5 and CD20/23 with weak expression of surface immunoglobulin) by flow cytometry. Diagnosis and staging of CLL can</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">usually be established by history, physical examination (careful evaluation for lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly), CBC with review of the blood smear, and immunophenotyping of the peripheral blood using flow cytometry. Classic findings on the peripheral smear include increased mature-appearing lymphocytes and smudge cells (peripheral smear artifact reflecting the fragility of the B-CLL cells to mechanical manipulation). Bone marrow studies are usually not needed for diagnosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The differential diagnosis for B-CLL includes other mature B- lymphoproliferative disorders such as mantle cell lymphoma, prolymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes. The clinical course and treatments differ widely for these disorders, particularly mantle cell lymphoma. Evaluation of clinical presentation, morphology, and immunophenotype is necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis (<span class="s1">Table 95-6</span>). Inclusion of flow cytometric evaluation for cyclin D1 or FISH analysis for t(11:14) is essential to rule out mantle cell lymphoma.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-6 <span class="s3">■ </span>IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF MATURE B-CELL NEOPLASMS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The original Rai classification (<span class="s1">Table 95-7</span>) implied an orderly progression from lymphocytosis alone to the successive development of adenopathy, organomegaly, and, eventually, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The prognostic importance of these variables has been confirmed although survival patterns differ primarily by the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories. Specific cytogenetic abnormalities correlate with prognosis. A 13q deletion is associated with a better prognosis, compared to deletions of 11q and 17p, which confer a worse prognosis.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>CLL RAI CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Therapy for B-cell CLL is not considered curative and therefore has been reserved for patients who are symptomatic or who progress to develop cytopenias. Leukocytosis alone (stage 0) does not require therapy, because the prognosis of these patients is excellent in the absence of the other poor prognostic factors. The rate of increase of leukocytosis is a better indicator of disease activity than the absolute count. Leukostasis, associated with high circulating blast counts in acute leukemias, does not generally occur in this condition because most of the lymphocytes are mature, small cells.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Treatment with systemic therapy or local radiation can be used to control symptoms in patients with stage I or II disease; however, symptomatic improvement does not appear to prolong survival. In contrast, patients with stage III or IV CLL have an improved survival with treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Treatment options for older adults have expanded significantly in the past several years. In general, initial systemic treatment options are determined by disease characteristics (del 17p, TP53 mutation, and IGVH mutation status) as well as functional status and comorbid conditions.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Most regimens utilize targeted therapies as a single agent or in combination. Standard first-line regimens for older adults include use of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (ie, ibrutinib or acalabrutinib) as a single agent or in combination with monoclonal antibodies (ie, rituximab or obinutuzumab) or the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax as single agent or in combination with obinutuzumab. Chemoimmunotherapy regimens may be considered in some settings for fit older adults with standard risk disease by those willing to undergo more intensive therapy for the potential of longer treatment-free intervals compared to BTK inhibitors, which are given as continuous oral therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Clinical trials in older adult populations have shown that ibrutinib improves outcomes compared to single-agent chlorambucil and chemoimmunotherapy using bendamustine plus rituximab. Overall, the totality of the evidence supports use of single-agent BTK inhibitor for many older adults as a first-line therapy. While well tolerated, there is an increased risk of bleeding, and caution is advised for patients who require anticoagulation. Cardiovascular toxicities are also a known risk including arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and hypertension.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frequently, presence of comorbid conditions and associated medications may determine choice of initial treatment regimen. For frail patients, or those with multiple chronic conditions, use of monoclonal antibody therapy is a reasonable choice. For example, a phase 3 randomized trial compared the efficacy of adding obinutuzumab (a humanized glycoengineered type 2 antibody to CD20) to chlorambucil versus rituximab specifically in patients with comorbidity. This study population had a median age of 73 and required a meaningful comorbidity burden (cumulative illness rating scale &gt; 6) for eligibility. The median progression-free survival was improved from 11.1 months to 26.7 months when comparing the anti-CD20 combination therapy arms with chlorambucil alone. Treatment with the obinutuzumab combination resulted in improved overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone and was superior to Rituxan combination therapy for progression-free survival and response. This study was a landmark trial by both demonstrating efficacy</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of a novel therapeutic combination but also doing so in an older patient population with comorbidity.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Autoimmune manifestations of CLL are common and include development of antibodies to platelets and red cells (IgG and C3 on direct antiglobulin test) and to erythroid precursors, resulting in red cell aplasia. For anemic patients, reticulocyte counts and direct Coombs testing should be obtained to help differentiate hemolysis from decreased bone marrow production. All of the autoimmune complications are indications for therapy with steroids or intravenous gamma globulin for refractory cases of red cell aplasia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Recurrent infections are the most common complications leading to death in CLL. Patients with stage 0 CLL have minimal increased risk of infection. In anticipation of gradual deterioration in immune response, however, pneumococcal vaccine and boosters should be administered while the potential for response is still intact. All other patients have higher risks for infection. As the disease advances clinically, immune function becomes progressively compromised, with increased susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and fungal infection. The subset of patients presenting with recurrent bacterial infections may benefit from administration of intravenous gamma globulin.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NON-HODGKIN AND HODGKIN LYMPHOMAS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The lymphoid malignancies comprise over 100 heterogeneous and complex entities as identified in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid malignancies (<span class="s1">Table 95-8</span>). Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are the most common lymphoid malignancy, representing a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders that originate from cells of the immune system, including B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, or natural killer (NK) cells. In the United States, the B-cell lymphomas predominate, making up 80% to 85% of lymphoma diagnoses, with T-cell histologies representing 15% to 20% of the balance; NK-cell lymphomas are rare at less than 1%. Broadly speaking, lymphomas can be characterized as either indolent, behaving with median survivals measured in up to decades, or aggressive, with life-threatening consequences in weeks to months if untreated.</p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:47.2pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-8 <span class="s3">■ </span>2016 WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) CLASSIFICATION OF MATURE LYMPHOID NEOPLASMS<span class="s21">A</span></p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Indolent lymphomas are more often identified incidentally during routine physical examination or laboratory evaluation, particularly with increased reliance on routine blood testing and imaging in the modern era. Often, these entities present with slowly progressive lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and potential cytopenias from bone marrow involvement. Examples include the prototypic follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphomas, and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In contrast, aggressive lymphomas are more likely to present with acute or subacute symptoms including a rapidly growing mass, systemic B symptoms (see next paragraph), elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, hypercalcemia, and hyperuricemia. Examples include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), and Burkitt lymphoma (BL).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Clinical characteristics of lymphomas include “B” symptoms, defined as fever greater than 38°C, unexplained weight loss greater than 10% of body weight over the past 6 months, and drenching night sweats. Up to 40% of patients with NHL may have B symptoms; more commonly evident in aggressive or biologically transformed disease (approaching 50%) than in low-grade lymphomas (&lt; 25%). Less common presenting features include skin rash, pruritus, fatigue, fever of unknown origin, effusions, and hypersensitivity to insect bites. Extranodal presentations occur in 10% to 35% of patients at initial diagnosis, with extranodal sites developing in half of patients over the course of their disease. As lymphocytes naturally transit through blood and can be found in any tissue compartment, lymphomas have been reported in essentially all conceivable sites.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epidemiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2021, an estimated 90,390 individuals will be diagnosed with lymphoma in the United States, 81,560 NHL and 8,830 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), with 21,680 individuals dying from a lymphoid malignancy. To put this in perspective, NHL and HL together account for 4.3% and 0.5% of all new cancer diagnoses, and NHL is the eighth leading cause of cancer death in the United States.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">With the aging of the population, the United States is projected to witness increases in incidence of NHL by 67% and HL by 70% in older adults by the year 2030. This fact is evidenced as well by the increasing median age of individuals with NHL over the last two decades. Consequently, the interplay between aging biology, comorbidity, and competing risks is ever more prevalent for the treating oncologist.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">World health organization classification system <span class="p">Although lymphoma classification has remained a complicated endeavor, iterative changes in the classification systems over the past 30 years have increasingly integrated cell of origin (B,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">T, NK), morphology, immunophenotype, and genetic and clinical features to define disease. The recent WHO updates have more broadly integrated new diseases and subtypes identified in the past, affirmed the importance of detecting viral entities in some diagnoses (eg, EBV, HHV8, and HTLV1), as well as increased the use of genetic features in diagnosis, such as cytogenetics and FISH in defining specific NHL entities.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Etiology </span>Despite an increasing understanding of biology, the cause of most lymphomas remains unknown. Mutational events inherent in the normal cell division process of lymphocytes are expected to result in a continuous random event rate. Increased incidences are associated with a personal family history of lymphoma, past radiation or chemotherapy treatment, immunosuppressive agents, smoking, and obesity. Environmental exposures to agricultural pesticides, hair dyes (prior to the 1980s), agent orange, and other dioxins accounted for an increased incidence of lymphoma in the central United States. Dysregulation of the immune system may precede a lymphoma diagnosis, with increased risk associated with autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Sjögren syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis), solid organ transplantation, chronic immunosuppression, and celiac sprue. A number of infections have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of lymphomas, either as a consequence of immune dysregulation or chronic antigenic drive. Examples include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T lymphoma atrophic virus type I (HTLV-I), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C, hepatitis B virus, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8).</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EBV in Lymphoma and Older Adults <span class="p">In the most recent WHO classification iteration of 2016, a provisional entity termed EBV (+) DLBCL, NOS was specified.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In previous versions (2008) this had been EBV+ DLBCL of older adults, but has since been reframed to reflect younger patients who may experience this diagnosis, which consists of an EBV-positive monoclonal large B-cell proliferation with no known history of immunodeficiency. Most patients have an activated B-cell (ABC) phenotype, strong NF-κβ activation, increased extranodal distribution at diagnosis, and inferior survival. Optimal treatment strategies are not defined. EBV has also been implicated in the pathogenesis and outcome of HL, with a negative impact on outcome in advanced age as distinct from younger patients.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s248">Genetic Factors—Translocations </span>NHLs are frequently characterized by balanced translocations, resulting in functional fusions that confer a survival advantage for the affected cell population (<span class="s1">Table 95-9</span>). Such translocations often involve the immunoglobulin heavy chain region on chromosome 14, leading to constitutive activation of the translocated partner and consequently to increased signaling for the translocated gene, such as the antiapoptotic pathways (<i>BCL2</i>), cell cycle proteins (<i>CCND1</i>), and cellular proliferation (<i>cMYC</i>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-9 <span class="s3">■ </span>LYMPHOMAS WITH KNOWN TRANSLOCATIONS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation and staging <span class="p">Evaluation of a patient with suspected lymphoma includes a careful history and physical examination, with close attention to lymphatic sites including Waldeyer ring and the spleen.

Fine-needle aspiration is often helpful as an initial discriminator between reactive adenopathy, carcinoma, and lymphoma but is not adequate for identifying lymphoma subtype. Studies needed include morphologic assessment, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, flow cytometry, FISH testing, cytogenetics, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies for clonality (immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies for B-cell clonality, T-cell receptor gene rearrangements for T-cell lymphomas), and increasingly gene expression profiling (GEP). Functional imaging (eg, positron emission tomography [PET] scan) may direct the site of biopsy when discordant fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity is present, with the most metabolically active lesions generally representing the most aggressive biology.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ann Arbor Staging System <span class="p">Originally developed in 1974 for HL, the Ann Arbor staging system was the equivalent of the TNM (tumor-lymph node- metastasis) staging system for lymphoid malignancies. This staging system defines disease location and extent and prognostic information, permitting cross-study comparisons, and establishes baseline disease extent to allow for response comparison. Modified in 1988, the Cotswold classification formally included CT scans and designations for bulky disease (X), dividing HL patients in four stages, with A and B subclassifications based on the absence or presence of B symptoms. Universally accepted response criteria in NHL and HL were published in 1999 by the NCI Working Group and revised in 2007 by the International Working Group (IWG) to incorporate PET and bone marrow immunohistochemistry (IHC)/flow in response assessment. This has formed the foundation for staging and response evaluations for NHL and HL over the last decades, acknowledging certain histologies have warranted their own staging and response assessment given varied clinical course (eg, CLL/SLL, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Of note, in contrast to many solid tumors, it is important to realize stage alone is often a poor arbiter of outcome in NHL. Clinical and biologic prognostic models, generally including stage as one of the risk factors, are</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">better predictors of outcome. For instance, a substantial number of DLBCL patients with advanced-stage III/IV disease will be cured, and for indolent lymphoma patients, stage IV disease is the norm, but survival is measured in decades.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s248">Updated Lugano Classification 2015 </span>The Lugano classification was published in 2014 in an effort to modernize recommendations for evaluation, staging, and response assessment for patients with HL and NHL (<span class="s1">Table 95-10</span>). The most salient changes included formal integration of PET scanning into initial staging for FDG-avid lymphomas, modification of the Ann Arbor terminology eliminating A/B qualifiers except for HL, and departure from routine bone marrow biopsy in DLBCL and HL based on functional imaging. FDG-PET utilizing the Deauville 5-point scale was integrated into response assessment. The Lugano revision of the staging criteria has suggested that bone marrow biopsy may not be necessary in most DLBCL or any HL if functional imaging fails to identify osseous lesions. One must acknowledge, however, that bone marrow involvement with indolent lymphoma is generally not evident on FDG-PET. A bone marrow biopsy should be performed if this knowledge alters clinical management (eg, identification of transformed biology).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-10 <span class="s3">■ </span>REVISED STAGING SYSTEM FOR PRIMARY NODAL LYMPHOMAS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s248" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Risk Prognostic Models</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I<span class="s255">MPACT OF AGE ACROS S ALL PROGNOS TIC MODELS </span>. <span class="p">The most frequently utilized model is the international prognostic index (IPI) that identifies five clinical factors as prognostic variables for progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in DLBCL (</span><span class="s1">Table 95-11</span><span class="p">). Importantly, chronologic age remains an integral part of many lymphoma clinical risk predictors, including the IPI, the follicular</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lymphoma IPI (FLIPI), the mantle cell IPI (MIPI), and the HL international prognostic score (IPS). However, the populations from which these prognostic indices were developed may not have uniformly included older patients. For example, the IPS included patients up to 65 years old, with ages 55 to 65 representing only 9% of the study population. It is well appreciated that age is a continuous variable and that a more clinically relevant cutoff above which patients are likely to require treatment modifications exists between 70 and 75 years in the current era.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-11 <span class="s3">■ </span>VARIOUS PROGNOSTIC SCORES FOR LYMPHOMAS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">From a clinical decision-making standpoint, distinctions in older populations among those age 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and 85 years or older are somewhat arbitrary but have clinical utility in minimizing heterogeneity when devising treatment guidelines. Ultimately, however, the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">variable nature of the aging process mandates thinking beyond chronologic age.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Biological Risk Factors <span class="p">In the modern era, with targeted therapies an increased reality, biomarkers to guide therapeutic decision making will be essential. The Ki67 proliferative index, a measure of cellular division, has been demonstrated to have prognostic impact in DLBCL and MCL, and in predicting increased risk of indolent NHL transformation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In DLBCL, the putative cell of origin as identified on GEP is prognostic, with germinal center-derived DLBCL enjoying a better outcome than non-GC (ABC phenotype). The concurrent presence of the antiapoptotic t(14;18) BCL2 translocation and a cMYC t(8;14) cellular proliferation signal (or less frequently BCL6 translocations) has been termed a “double hit” biology (DH). Roughly 10% of patients with DLBCL will have DH biology, a finding associated with very aggressive disease, older age, higher CNS risk, and no current standard of care recommendation. A larger population (~1/3) of DLBCL patients may have protein overexpression of BCL and MYC, termed double expressers, and have increased disease risk as well, but to a more variable degree.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CNS Risk Assessment <span class="p">CNS evaluation with lumbar puncture and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important in patients with a clinical suspicion of nervous system involvement or those at high risk for CNS involvement at presentation. CSF investigation should include cell count, glucose, protein, cytology, as well as the more sensitive flow cytometry. This is generally a consideration in aggressive lymphomas and high-grade disease, with involvement rare in mantle cell or indolent lymphomas. Increased risk of CNS involvement historically has been associated with higher clinical risk factors, anatomic sites of involvement such as the testes, breast, multiple extranodal sites, and bone marrow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Recently, a predictive model for DLBCL risk of CNS relapse was reported. This validated model comprises six factors (age, PS, LDH, stage, extranodal sites, and kidney/adrenal involvement) with stratification of CNS relapse based on number of risk factors. Although the optimal method (intrathecal or high-dose methotrexate) and the actual magnitude of risk reduction in CNS prophylaxis remain debated, this predictive model is useful when considering the pros and cons in older adults.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatme nt <span class="p">In the older patient, establishing clinical and disease-associated risk predictors is an essential part of the assessment, but this evaluation still represents an incomplete clinical picture for the treating oncologist. With increasing age, the patient may have aging-associated risk factors that may be equally or more profound than the aforementioned lymphoma factors and ultimately define the range of therapeutic options. The oncogeriatric factors of life expectancy, comorbidity, frailty, and geriatric syndromes independently predict treatment-associated morbidity and mortality, and consequently become essential considerations when deriving a treatment strategy. Ultimately, these clinical concerns are most weighty when there is an aggressive histology that is potentially curable, but therapy is associated with very real risks. In recent years, several studies have identified frailty as a predictor of chemotherapy tolerance and survival. Geriatric assessments provide physicians with a tool to individualize decision-making based on factors beyond age and documented comorbidity. Further, there are modified chemotherapy regimens geared toward older or more frail patients, with the goal of reducing toxicity while optimizing survival. One example is a reduced dose version of the common combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride (hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine sulfate (Oncovin), and prednisone, or CHOP.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Comorbidity and Frailty Assessments <span class="p">Comorbidity is prevalent in older patients, with 60% to 70% of NHL patients older than 60 years possessing some comorbidity. Frequently used measures include the Charlson comorbidity score and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics, both of which capture information distinct from lymphoma-specific prognostic indexes and are independently associated with risk. The presence of comorbidity in NHL and HL patients has been associated with increased treatment-related mortality (TRM), treatment toxicity, lower dose intensity, and higher treatment failure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Frailty is a distinct syndrome from comorbidity and has its own impact on outcomes (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 42</span>). Frailty is often defined practically, with suggested criteria including age greater than 80 or 85, dependence in ADL, exhaustion, slow gait speed, decreased hand grip, unintentional weight loss, and decreased physical activity. Frail patients have shorter life expectancies than nonfrail patients and have a higher likelihood of toxicity with interventions such as chemotherapy. Thus, frailty identifies a group of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">patients at greatest risk given lack of functional reserves, and palliative chemotherapy approaches are generally recommended in this setting.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s248">Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment </span>Performance status and clinical judgment alone are insufficient to identify at-risk older individuals and may misclassify a significant percent of patients, exposing them to harm or denying curative intent. In this vein, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) guidelines recommend performance of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in older patients. Instructively, Tucci and colleagues demonstrated that a CGA applied in 173 DLBCL patients older than 69 years segregated fit (46%), unfit (16%), and frail (38%) patients with significantly different outcomes (OS 84% fit vs 47% nonfit, <i>p </i>&lt; .0001) and a lack of clinical benefit from curative intent therapy in the frail category.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) integrated a CGA tool into a trial treatment paradigm that stratified 334 DLBCL patients older than 65 years as either fit (68%) or frail (29%). Fit patients were randomized on a trial between RCHOP and R-mini-CEOP and had excellent and equivalent outcomes, while frail patients were treated per investigator choice. Frail patients were more frequently older (median age 78, range 65–93), with advanced stage (62%) and high risk, and reported a 5-year estimated OS of 28% despite polychemotherapy administration in three-fourths of patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TRM was 18% in this group compared with only 8% in the fit group. Most recently, this group completed a prospective project on older patients with DLBCL using a simplified version of their original geriatric assessment. The simplified assessment included age greater than or equal to 80, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics comorbidity assessment, ADLs and IADLs. They identified 55% fit, 28% unfit, and 18% frail patients. Future prospective trials will need to build upon this work to help optimize treatment decisions for older patients with DLBCL.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pharmacologic Considerations for Older NHL Patients</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Neuropathic agents : Vinca alkaloids (vincris tine, vinblas tine), cis platin, oxaliplatin,</p><p class="s256" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN, BORTEZOMIB<span class="s257">. </span><span class="p">A number of approved agents for the treatment of NHL are associated with peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.

The anthracyclines are associated with a defined risk of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy that is related to cumulative dose (although rarely idiopathic), with risk increasing significantly with doxorubicin equivalents in</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">excess of 400 mg/m<span class="s22">2</span> lifetime. Hypertension is an established risk factor. Infusional doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin may have an increased safety margin, and a variety of non-anthracycline regimens exist when there is an absolute contraindication that may still preserve a curative intent.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Small Molecule Inhibitors <span class="p">Ibrutinib is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), FDA approved for the treatment of CLL and MCL. With longer follow-up, propensity toward bleeding has been identified with consideration for risk-versus-benefit in patients requiring antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapies.

With a median age at diagnosis of greater than or equal to 65 years, DLBCL is in many ways a disease of older individuals. With the aging population, there is a pressing need to understand age-related host and disease factors, how they impact therapeutic choices and outcomes, and to develop specific strategies to address these factors.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatme nt <span class="p">DLBCL is an aggressive entity with the natural history characterized by rapid progression and death within weeks to months in the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">absence of treatment. Based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), frontline therapy with anthracycline-based chemoimmunotherapy for DLBCL (eg, rituximab-CHOP) results in overall survival rates of 60% to 70% and represents the best chance for cure, as the majority of patients with relapsed or refractory disease will die of lymphoma. However, older patients frequently have comorbidities and functional impairment limiting feasibility of standard therapy. The initial decision regarding the feasibility of anthracycline-based chemotherapy is consequently paramount and must integrate assessments of organ function, clinical judgment, comorbidity, and performance status as previously discussed. Chemotherapy may extend survival, even among patients where curative intent cannot be achieved.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Early-stage DLBCL (stage I/II without bulk) may be treated with fewer cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiation. Whether or not to include radiation consolidation may be informed by disease location, associated RT toxicity, comorbidity, and life expectancy. Radiation should be considered for definitive therapy in patients who cannot tolerate chemotherapy. The standard of care for initial treatment of DLBCL in both older and younger patients is chemoimmunotherapy comprised of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (RCHOP 21) given every 21 days for 6 to 8 cycles. Ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in groups at higher risk for relapse based on unfavorable disease biology are exploring regimens such as dose-adjusted R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide phosphate, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) regimen or adding novel agents such as bortezomib, ibrutinib, and lenalidomide.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients who relapse following RCHOP chemotherapy have a poor prognosis, even when second-line therapy and subsequent high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell rescue (HDT/ASCR) are utilized. For the vast majority of older individuals, this intensive strategy is not feasible due to age-related comorbidity and increased TRM associated with transplant approaches. In this setting, goals of care shift to disease control and palliation. Several novel agents are being explored for relapsed/refractory disease for patients ineligible for transplant.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prephase Concept and Reduced Intensity <span class="p">Often at initial presentation, disease-related factors impair host performance status and are associated with treatment- associated morbidity and mortality.

In general, the trade-off includes a reduction in efficacy with the advantage of reduced toxicity and TRM.

CAR-T therapy uses a patient’s own T lymphocytes that are genetically modified to encode a chimeric antigen receptor that in turn directs the modified T cells against cancer cells. Several pivotal studies led to approvals for CAR-T use among patients whose B-cell NHL has progressed after more than or equal to two lines of previous therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is important to recognize the potential toxicity for CAR-T infusions.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The complications of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome among the two commercial CAR-T products have been well-described. As the modified cells encounter native CD-19 expressing cells, they proliferate and release cytokines resulting in an inflammatory response and CRS. This often manifests as systemic signs and symptoms mimicking sepsis (fever, hypotension, coagulopathy, multiorgan failure), and can occur within hours to a few days after drug infusion. A post hoc analysis of the ZUMA-1 trial with axicabtagene ciloleucel for relapsed/refractory DLBCL found that outcomes of response and survival were similar to slightly better for older versus younger patients (patients 65 years or older made up one-quarter of the trial cohort). However, the incidence of grade more than or equal to 3 neurologic toxicity was higher (44% vs 28%) in the older age cohort. Future studies are needed to identify which older patients are optimal candidates for CAR-T therapy through understanding of patient preferences, risk of toxicity, and functional status.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Follicular Lymphoma/Indolent Lymphomas</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction <span class="p">Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common NHL histology in the United States, accounting for approximately 30% of new cases. FL is the prototypical indolent or slow-growing lymphoma, characterized by systemic disease with a protracted disease course associated with waxing and waning adenopathy that is frequently asymptomatic and may not require therapy. Average survival can exceed 15 years.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Most patients with FL will present with painless adenopathy, with bone marrow involvement in up to 70%. FL remains a chronic illness that is characterized by the need for intermittent therapy with generally shorter and shorter response intervals. Marked heterogeneity does exist in disease</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">course, with perhaps 10% to 15% of patients experiencing a more aggressive disease course with shorter survival.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Indications for the rapy </span>Many patients will present with advanced-stage disease but will not require immediate intervention. Asymptomatic patients with low burden of disease may be expectantly monitored with no detrimental effect on overall survival. Randomized studies have shown that the early initiation of therapy did not improve long-term disease-specific or overall survival, supporting an expectant monitoring approach. The median time from diagnosis to treatment in controlled settings has generally been about 3 years. Spontaneous regression of adenopathy in FL may occur in 10% to 15% of patients. Indications for therapy, which is generally chemoimmunotherapy in the modern era, are derived from clinical trial criteria established by the French in the context of clinical trials (termed the GELF criteria) and adopted by the NCCN guidelines. These criteria generally relate to tumor burden (<span class="s1">Table 95-13</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-13 <span class="s3">■ </span>INDICATIONS FOR THERAPY IN FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rapy—Localized disease <span class="p">While expectant monitoring may be reasonable in some patients with localized indolent lymphoma, others will require therapy. Radiation alone may be an option for 5% to 10% of patients who present with localized disease (stage I or II), with roughly 50% of patients remaining long-term disease free. Patients with bulky FL are generally managed according to advanced-stage strategies.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rapy—Advanced-stage disease</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemoimmunotherapy <span class="p">Therapy for advanced-stage FL is generally indicated when there are criteria indicating increased tumor burden and symptomatic disease. Current therapies are not curative, so the goal of treatment is resolution of disease symptoms and maintenance of remission, balanced with toxicity. FL are very responsive to immunotherapy alone and in combination with chemotherapy, as well as radiation, with a rapid expansion of available agents in the current era. In almost all instances, the addition of rituximab to a chemotherapy backbone has consistently resulted in improved response rates and increased PFS, as well as of evidence of increased OS. Alkylator-based regimens (eg, RCHOP and R-CVP), purine analogue regimens (eg, R-FCM), and rituximab-bendamustine have all been evaluated in the frontline treatment of symptomatic FL. Overall response rates are generally in the 80% to 95% range, with median response durations over 2 years. For older frail patients, low-dose targeted radiation or single-agent rituximab may provide effective palliation.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s248">Relapsed Disease </span>At relapse, the selection of salvage regimens depends on the efficacy and tolerability of prior therapies. Rituximab is generally included if the benefit from initial therapy was more than 6 months, and data support maintenance rituximab in the relapsed setting as well. Radioimmunotherapy with <span class="s22">90</span>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and <span class="s22">131</span>I-tositumumab represents an effective</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">approach and is a particular consideration in older patients with comorbidities not appropriate for chemotherapy. The oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor idelalisib has proven safety and efficacy in relapsed indolent NHL refractory to rituximab and alkylators. Other aggressive options as used in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, such as ASCT or CAR-T therapy may be considered for select patients with short remission duration (&lt; 2 years) from initial chemoimmunotherapy induction.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk of transformation <span class="p">Up to half of patients may experience transformation to a more aggressive biology that approximates DLBCL in appearance.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinically, transformation is often heralded by a rapidly growing nodal mass, new-onset B symptoms, hypercalcemia, elevated LDH, increased Ki67%, and higher standardized uptake values (SUVs) on FDG-PET. Once transformation is documented, treatment generally follows DLBCL paradigms to eradicate the aggressive life-threatening clone. Median survival following transformation is reported at less than 2 years.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hodgkin Lymphoma</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While HL median age of diagnosis is 39 years, there is a bimodal age peak of distribution, with peaks of incidence in the 20s to 30s and again in the 60s to 70s. Older patients pose a particularly difficult dynamic for the treatment team. If therapy can be given safely, these patients can be cured. However, many patients are not given dose-intense chemotherapy due to perceived or actual risk of toxicity. Older patients are also less represented in clinical trials (&lt; 5% of HL trial demographics are older) leaving less guidance and fewer advancements in the treatment of older patients. Hence, there remains a significant gap in curability for older patients due to disease biology, aging- associated vulnerabilities, and therapy administered.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Biology and outcomes in older patie nts <span class="p">HL is characterized by the presence of malignant multinucleated giant cells, termed “Reed-Sternberg” cells, that have a typical immunohistochemical profile with expression of CD15 and CD30. Four histologic subtypes are recognized: nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte-rich, and lymphocyte-depleted classical HL. Another subtype of HL, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), is even rarer, both in terms of incidence (only 5% of all HL) and presentation at advanced age.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older patients with HL, typically defined as older than or equal to 60 years, have poorer outcomes compared to younger patients. The reasons for these disparities are many, including disease biology, comorbidity, functional status, relative chemotherapy intensity, and toxicity. A recent population analysis evaluated first-line treatment patterns in adults 65 years or older with incident HL in the United States. Less than one-quarter of patients received “full regimen” dose-intense chemotherapy, and 26% of patients received no treatment within 4 months of diagnosis. This study highlighted the heterogeneity of treatment practices and patient characteristics in this particularly vulnerable population. Further, there is a lack of prognostic tools for this population. The IPS developed by Hansenclever is the most widely</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">used prognostic score, but there were no patients older than 65 years at diagnosis, making the IPS difficult to apply to older individuals.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Retrospective assessments have suggested comorbidity and ADLs are important predictors in older HL patients.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Early-stage disease (stage I-IIA) <span class="p">The standard of care for early-stage patients is the chemotherapy combination of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), with or without radiation, depending on location of disease and initial response to treatment. Recently, trials in early-stage favorable patients have integrated interim PET into the treatment paradigm, allowing omission of radiation based on initial response. Additionally, the toxicity of bleomycin outweighs its benefits after more than two cycles of bleomycin. Thus, it is now recommended that after two cycles, older patients receive AVD without bleomycin to protect from pulmonary toxicity.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advanced-stage disease (stage III/IV) <span class="p">For patients with advance stage HL, ABVD is the standard of care in the United States. Alternate regimens, such as Stanford V and BEACOPP, are associated with increased toxicity in older adults. The SHIELD study was specifically designed for adults with HL older than age 60; they prospectively studied the VEPEMB (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, etoposide, mitoxantrone, bleomycin, prednisolone) program in this cohort, with phase II data demonstrating 3-year PFS and OS of 58% and 66%, respectively, for advanced-stage patients. For early-stage patients, 74% of patients achieved CR with PFS at 3 years of 87%.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Novel approaches to older adults with Hodgkin lymphoma <span class="p">In recent years, there has been a shift to exploring non-chemotherapeutic options that may be less toxic for older patients. Brentuximab vedotin (Bv) is an anti-CD30 antibody that disrupts microtubule networks, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of HL cells. Bv was first FDA approved for relapsed/refractory HL, and has since been approved in combination with AVD (A-AVD) for advanced-stage HL. Since then, several trials are being completed to assess combination therapy of Bv with additional agents for treatment of newly diagnosed HL. A multicenter phase II study used sequential Bv prior to and after AVD for patients older than or equal to 60 years at diagnosis. They found an 82% and 95% overall response rate after the lead-in Bv cycles and then six cycles of ABVD, respectively. Two year progression-free and overall survival rates were 84% and 93%, respectively, with patients with lower geriatric</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">comorbidity score experiencing higher PFS rates. Additional studies have assessed Bv as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab or dacarbazine as potential therapeutic options.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relapsed/refractory disease <span class="p">At the time of relapsed/refractory disease, understanding suitability for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is an important early step for older patients. For younger patients, standard treatment is second-line chemotherapy followed by ASCT for chemosensitive disease; over 60% of patients may be cured. However, ASCT is not appropriate for many older patients, who should be evaluated for fitness for ASCT in the context of comorbidity, frailty, and life expectancy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For patients not eligible for ASCT, goals of care include achieving disease control balanced with toxicity. Patients may be treated with single agents or novel combinations. Patients may be treated with single-agent Bv or gemcitabine with or without radiation therapy when appropriate.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additionally, novel approaches, such as immunotherapy may be considered. Further studies are being conducted to assess treatment options for older patients with relapsed/refractory disease, but this population remains a challenge to treat.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Follow-Up and Survivorship in NHL and HL</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PET-CT scan should generally be utilized at the end of treatment to assess response, which may reveal complete metabolic response or be indeterminate, requiring integration of clinical context. A complete metabolic response, even with persistent mass, is considered complete remission and has been associated with similar outcomes. CT imaging is preferred in low or variable FDG-avid histologies.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Surveillance imaging in remission is increasingly discouraged, given the lack of evidence demonstrating improvement in survival and concerns over exposure to medical radiation. The clinical context is important to consider when making these decisions, as risk of relapse is greatest in the 1 to 2 years following completion of therapy for aggressive histologies. Given the long natural history of indolent lymphomas, judicious use of follow-up scans can be considered, particularly when intra-abdominal retroperitoneal disease is present. The risks of secondary malignancies from medical radiation exposure may have less impact in patients diagnosed at older age, given the latency period.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PLASMA CELL DISORDERS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plasma cell disorders (PCDs) encompass a range of clonal conditions, ranging from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is by definition asymptomatic and requires no treatment, through multiple myeloma, wherein the clonal plasma cells cause end-organ damage, require therapy, and will ultimately cause the patient’s death if left untreated. The incidence of PCDs increases with age, and the presence of multimorbidity may make it a challenge to distinguish between end-organ damage (ie, anemia, renal insufficiency, or vertebral compression fractures) related to a PCD versus another underlying comorbid condition. <span class="s1">Table 95-14 </span>summarizes key aspects of the PCDs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-14 <span class="s3">■ </span>PLASMA CELL DISORDERS: DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Laboratory Evaluation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PCDs are among the few neoplasms where routine laboratory testing other than tissue biopsy can detect the “fingerprint” of a clonal population, in this case detection of a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. This protein may be referred to as a paraprotein, M-component/M-spike or restricted peak. The monoclonal protein may be an intact immunoglobulin (comprising</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">both heavy and light chains), light chain only or, rarely, heavy chain only. Advances in laboratory technology have allowed more sensitive and specific detection and identification of a paraprotein and have improved our ability to monitor response to treatment in those PCDs that require treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Serum protein electrophoresis </span>In serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), the serum proteins are separated by an electric field on an agarose gel and stained with Amido black, and quantitated by densitometer tracing of the gel. An alternate, more sensitive SPEP method, involves separation of serum proteins in a capillary tube in a liquid phase buffer by a high-voltage current and quantitation by light absorbance. The latter mechanism is more accurate as it does not rely on uptake of dye. Monoclonal proteins are named for the protein region in which they migrated, such as α<span class="s11">1</span>, α<span class="s11">2</span>, β, or γ (eg, “γ-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">restricted peak”).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Serum immunofixation <span class="p">Immunofixation is more sensitive than is SPEP, allowing for confirmation of monoclonality and determination of the type of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain class of the involved protein.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, it is purely qualitative and does not allow quantitation. In this test, the separated serum proteins are tested with specific antibodies (eg, anti-γ, anti-μ, anti-α, anti-κ, anti-λ) and stained.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Urine protein electrophoresis <span class="p">Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) is performed in a similar manner as described for SPEP. It allows quantitation of the types of protein found in the urine. Generally the percentage of each type of protein is reported, allowing distinction between proteinuria caused primarily by albumin versus light chain production. Coupled with the total amount of protein in a 24-hour urine collection, this allows quantitation of the total amount of monoclonal protein eliminated in the urine.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Urine immunofixation <span class="p">Urine immunofixation, like serum immunofixation, is more sensitive for the presence of a paraprotein. Given that only the light chains are freely filtered at the glomerulus, generally only kappa or lambda light chains are detected on immunofixation of the urine, though occasionally heavy chain fragments are detectable. Urine immunofixation is a qualitative test only.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Serum-fre e light chain assay <span class="p">The serum-free light chain is a quantitative measure of excess kappa or lambda light chains produced by a plasma cell clone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under normal circumstances, a slight excess of light chains is produced relative to heavy chains in the production of intact immunoglobulins,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">resulting in small quantities of kappa and lambda light chains free in the serum. The ratio of kappa to lambda light chains is roughly 1:1, with the normal range of ratios of kappa to lambda ranging from 0.26 to 1.65. In a clonal PCD, the ratio will either be greater than the upper limit of normal with a kappa paraprotein, or less than the lower limit of normal with a lambda paraprotein. Notably, as the light chains are renally cleared, the absolute level of kappa and lambda light chains may be elevated in patients with renal impairment, but the ratio will remain close to normal.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Definition </span>MGUS is an asymptomatic premalignant condition characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. The 2014 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria defined that a diagnosis of MGUS requires a total serum M-component less than 30 g/L, with bone marrow plasma cells (or lymphoplasmacytic cells in the case of an IgM paraprotein) less than 10% and no end-organ damage related to the monoclonal protein (eg, “CRAB” criteria: hyper<i>c</i>alcemia, <i>r</i>enal insufficiency, <i>a</i>nemia, or <i>b</i>one lesions) or amyloidosis (see <span class="s1">Table 95-14</span>).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology <span class="p">The prevalence of MGUS in the United States is approximately 3% and ranges from 1% to 5% in other countries throughout the world. It increases in prevalence with age, and is more common in men and African- Americans. Additional risk factors include having a primary relative with a history of MGUS or myeloma, exposure to pesticides, rural residence, and possibly obesity.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathophysiology (classification) <span class="p">MGUS may be classified as IgG, IgA, light chain MGUS, or IgM MGUS. MGUS may progress to multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, or primary amyloidosis. IgM MGUS generally does not progress to multiple myeloma, but to Waldenström macroglobulinemia or amyloidosis. The rate of progression to symptomatic myeloma is about 1% per year; high-, high-intermediate, low-intermediate, and low-risk groups are defined based on the type of monoclonal protein, level of the M-spike, and whether the serum-free light chain ratio is normal.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">MGUS may be discovered when the patient is undergoing evaluation for another disorder and is found to have a monoclonal protein. This may include evaluation for anemia, renal insufficiency, proteinuria,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">osteoporosis or fractures, hypergammaglobulinemia, or peripheral neuropathy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation <span class="p">The identification of a monoclonal protein requires evaluation for the presence of end-organ damage. The history and physical examination should focus on symptoms suggestive of CRAB criteria. A CBC should be obtained to rule out anemia; a basic metabolic panel estimates renal function and rules out hypercalcemia. In the presence of concomitant explanations for anemia (eg, iron deficiency) or renal insufficiency (eg, established diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy with stable renal function), the criterion for end- organ damage is not satisfied. Finally, bone imaging is required. The traditional skeletal survey is being replaced by more sensitive bone imaging, including 15-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (either whole body or spine), or low- dose whole-body computed tomography (CT).</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management <span class="p">MGUS does not require treatment. Patients identified as having MGUS are followed at 6- to 12-month intervals for progression to a malignant disorder, with monitoring for anemia, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, or bone lesions.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smoldering Myeloma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition <span class="p">Smoldering myeloma is intermediate between MGUS and symptomatic multiple myeloma, defined as the presence of an IgG or IgA monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 30 g/L or urinary monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 500 mg per 24 hours and/or clonal bone marrow plasma cells 10% to 60%. End-organ damage related to the paraprotein (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions, or amyloidosis) must be absent.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathophysiology (classification) <span class="p">Only 50% of patients with smoldering myeloma progress to require therapy in 5 years (10% risk per year), and 30% are free of progression to myeloma at 10 years.

Current evidence supports the fact that all cases of multiple myeloma are preceded by MGUS. As with MGUS, male gender, African-American race, and advancing age are all associated with increased incidence of multiple myeloma. With the aging of the population, there will be a 57% increase in the incidence of myeloma, and more strikingly, a 77% increase in the incidence of myeloma in people older than age 65.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">The most common presenting symptom is bone pain, present in three out of five patients. Back pain is generally of less than 1 year in duration. Fatigue is present in one-third of patients. Other symptoms may include altered mental status or constipation due to hypercalcemia, recurrent infections, or weight loss. Patients who have developed cord compression</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">may present with paresis. Some patients may present with abnormal laboratory findings alone, including anemia, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, or an elevated total serum protein level with hypoalbuminemia (an elevated “protein gap”).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Evaluation </span>Evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, seeking evidence of end-organ damage. Examination may reveal pallor, indicative of anemia, kyphosis related to vertebral compression fractures, or mental status changes due to hypercalcemia. Laboratory evaluation includes CBCs, comprehensive metabolic profile, serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, quantitative immunoglobulins, serum-free light chains, lactate dehydrogenase, and β<span class="s11">2</span>-microglobulin. Radiographic evaluation begins with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">advanced bone imaging, such as low-dose whole body CT, PET-CT, or whole body MRI. Skeletal survey alone is no longer considered adequate for detection of myeloma bone lesions. Notably, nuclear medicine bone scans are generally negative in multiple myeloma, given that myeloma bone lesions are purely lytic. Finally, pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis is obtained with bone marrow core biopsy and aspirate. The bone marrow aspirate is also sent for cytogenetics and FISH for chromosomal abnormalities commonly seen in multiple myeloma.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Pathophysiology (classification) </span>The current staging system used for multiple myeloma is the Revised-International Staging System. This system, replacing the older Durie-Salmon staging system and its precursor International Staging System, requires the serum albumin, β<span class="s11">2</span>-microglobulin, and lactate</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dehydrogenase levels as well as the presence or absence of higher risk chromosomal abnormalities, including t4;14, t14;16, and del 17p.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management <span class="p">The management of multiple myeloma in older adults can be complex.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic <span class="p">As a systemic disease, multiple myeloma essentially categorically requires systemic therapy. However, radiation or surgery may have a role in the management of skeletal lesions or the oncologic emergency spinal cord compression. Patients who present with cord compression may undergo surgical decompression followed by radiation with a goal of preserving or restoring function. Patients who present with pathologic fractures or lesions of the long bones at risk for pathologic fracture may undergo surgical stabilization to preserve or restore function; such lesions</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are generally irradiated postoperatively to facilitate healing and decrease pain. Other painful bone lesions may be irradiated for pain relief.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drugs <span class="p">The therapeutic options for multiple myeloma have improved dramatically in the past 20 years, resulting in a near-doubling of the average overall survival times. For adults aged 65 to 74, the 5-year survival rate improved from 27% in 1998 to 2004 to 39% in 2005 to 2009 then to 48% in 2010 to 2014. For adults aged 75 to 90, the 5-year survival rate improved from 16% in 1998 to 2004 to 23% in 2005 to 2009 then to 31% in 2010 to 2014. Continued advances promise continuing improvement in the duration of survival.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Melphalan. <span class="p">For over three decades, oral melphalan was the standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma. When melphalan is combined with prednisone, about 50% of patients will have at least a partial response to therapy. The main toxicity of melphalan is myelosuppression. Melphalan is still used in some regimens for older adults, but has largely been supplanted by newer more effective treatment options.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Corticos teroids . </span>Corticosteroids are incorporated into essentially every antimyeloma regimen. Corticosteroids have rapid direct antimyeloma efficacy and act synergistically with other agents. Corticosteroids are often used when patients present acutely and highly symptomatically with a new diagnosis of multiple myeloma. High-dose corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone 40 mg orally × 4 days) can be used to rapidly ameliorate hypercalcemia or significant bone pain. However, corticosteroid dosing should be chosen cautiously for longer-term management. In a randomized trial of lenalidomide with high-dose versus low-dose dexamethasone (lenalidomide plus dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1–4, 9–12, and 17– 20 [RD] versus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone 40 mg weekly), RD was associated with a higher response rate but <i>poorer overall survival </i>due to increased toxicity (primarily venous thromboembolic events and infections). Thus, high-dose corticosteroids should be avoided in older patients due to increased risk of treatment-related mortality. Further, a recent randomized trial demonstrated that in intermediate-fit older adults, discontinuation of steroids after the first 9 months of the initial therapy resulted in superior event-free survival, indicating less toxicity with preserved antimyeloma efficacy. Similar studies have not been conducted in the setting of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">relapsed/refractory myeloma, and steroids remain an anchor in the treatment of myeloma.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thalidomide. <span class="p">The antimyeloma efficacy of the immunomodulatory agent thalidomide was first reported in 1999, heralding a revolution in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Over the first decade of the new century, thalidomide was utilized in a number of combinations, including with melphalan and prednisone (MPT) and bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMPT). The toxicities of thalidomide include sedation, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, and venous thromboembolic events. It is used less frequently now in preference for more effective and less toxic options.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lenalidomide. <span class="p">Lenalidomide, another immunomodulatory agent, has largely supplanted thalidomide due to improved tolerability and efficacy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lenalidomide’s toxicities include venous thromboembolism and cytopenias. A randomized trial demonstrated that continuous lenalidomide with dexamethasone improves progression-free and overall survival over MPT or lenalidomide and dexamethasone of a fixed duration (18 months), establishing this regimen as a standard of care in older adults with multiple myeloma. Dose must be adjusted for renal insufficiency.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pomalidomide. <span class="p">Pomalidomide is approved in the United States for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have previously been treated with bortezomib and lenalidomide.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bortezomib. <span class="p">Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor administered parenterally for initial therapy or at relapse. It was initially administered intravenously and twice weekly, a regimen which was found to be excessively toxic in older adults. Once-weekly subcutaneous administration of bortezomib is tolerated much better in older adults, with similar efficacy. The main toxicities of bortezomib are peripheral neuropathy, cytopenias, and herpes zoster. Bortezomib is administered in combination with dexamethasone, and may be used in combination with another agent, such as lenalidomide or cyclophosphamide. Bortezomib does not require dose adjustment for renal impairment.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carfilzomib. <span class="p">Carfilzomib is the second-in-class proteasome inhibitor, approved in the United States for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received bortezomib and an immunomodulatory</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">agent (either lenalidomide or thalidomide). Its toxicities include cytopenias and dyspnea. Cardiotoxicity is an increasingly recognized adverse effect of particular concern in older adults.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ixazomib. <span class="p">Ixazomib is an orally administered proteasome inhibitor with efficacy and toxicity similar to bortezomib. It is approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed myeloma, but there is interest in its use in the initial therapy setting, particularly for older adults.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monoclonal antibodies . <span class="p">Elotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against SLAMF7, a marker found on both selected normal hematopoietic cells and myeloma cells. It is approved for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed myeloma. Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD38, present on plasma cells. It is available in both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations, with its main toxicities being infusion reactions and risk of infection. It is approved for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for older adults who will not be undergoing stem cell transplant, as well as in the relapsed setting.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combination regimens . <span class="p">Numerous combinations of the above agents have been examined in clinical trials. Generally, combination regimens result in higher response rates, but also in greater toxicity; whether the combination improves outcomes like overall survival depends on the balance of efficacy and toxicity. The IMWG recommends that older adults with multiple myeloma deemed more frail receive either well-tolerated three-drug combinations or only two-drug combinations (lenalidomide and dexamethasone).</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">High-dos e therapy and autologous s tem cell trans plantation. <span class="p">Select, fit older</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adults, generally under age 75 but occasionally older, may be candidates for high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Even with the tremendous advances in treatment, the approach of induction therapy, high- dose therapy/autologous stem cell transplant, followed by maintenance therapy, continues to produce the longest durations of myeloma control of all therapeutic options.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Emerging therapies . <span class="p">The entire wealth of emerging treatments, either approved in relapsed settings or still investigational, is beyond the scope of this chapter. Among the newest options approved are selinexor, belantamab</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mafodotin-blmf, isatuximab, and melphalan flufenamide. A paucity of data on the toxicity of the newest drugs in older patients presents a challenge for clinicians and patients considering these approaches. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells are a still-investigational approach expected to emerge in practice in 2021.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prevention of complications</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Skeletal-Related Events <span class="p">Intravenous bisphosphonates are effective for primary or secondary prevention of skeletal-related events (including pathologic fractures or painful lytic lesions requiring radiation). Zoledronic acid and pamidronate are utilized in the United States. Denosumab, the RANK ligand inhibitor, is approved for patients with multiple myeloma and utilized in patients with renal impairment in whom bisphosphonates are contraindicated.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Infection Prophylaxis <span class="p">Patients with multiple myeloma should receive the pneumococcal vaccine and annual influenza vaccinations. Patients receiving certain treatments should receive herpes zoster prophylaxis with acyclovir or valacyclovir. One randomized trial demonstrated a reduction in fever or early death in patients treated with levofloxacin for the first 3 months after diagnosis.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Special issues</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frailty <span class="p">Given that the majority of patients with myeloma are older than age 65, there has been great interest in developing an easily implemented measure of frailty. The International Myeloma Working Group developed a frailty score based on age greater than 80, dependence in ADL/IADL, and comorbidities that predict toxicity of therapy and survival. Studies selecting patients based on their frailty level (fit, intermediate, or frail) or adjusting treatment based on the same are emerging and underway, promising improved means to tailor treatment to the health of older adults.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Comorbidity <span class="p">The presence of comorbidities is prognostic in older adults with multiple myeloma. Comorbidities may also limit treatment options or influence the rates of toxicity. For example, underlying peripheral neuropathy may limit the use of bortezomib. Diabetes may limit the dose of corticosteroids due to hyperglycemia. Patients and clinicians may have concerns about using carfilzomib in the presence of underlying cardiac disease given risk for dyspnea.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Solitary Plasmacytomas</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Definition </span>Solitary plasmacytomas are malignant proliferations of plasma cells located either in bone or soft tissue, in the absence of other evidence of end- organ damage, and with no or minimal (&lt; 10%) plasma cells in the bone marrow (see <span class="s1">Table 95-14</span>).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology <span class="p">Plasmacytomas are a relatively rare PCD, with an incidence rate of 0.34 cases per 100,000 person-years. Similar to multiple myeloma, plasmacytomas are more common among males and those of Black race.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">Solitary plasmacytomas of bone occur most commonly in the axial skeleton, including the vertebrae or pelvis. Solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas occur most commonly in the upper aerodigestive tract, including the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oral cavity, or sinuses. Presentation is generally related to local symptoms of the mass.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation <span class="p">Evaluation of plasmacytomas proceeds as the evaluation for multiple myeloma, with the goal of ruling out multiple myeloma.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic <span class="p">The treatment for solitary plasmacytoma is radiation therapy, with curative intent. Radiation is highly effective at establishing local control of the plasmacytoma, and relapses within the radiation field are unusual. If the patient experiences recurrence, it is generally progression to multiple myeloma rather than a local recurrence or persistence of the plasmacytoma.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drugs <span class="p">Systemic therapy as for multiple myeloma is utilized in the setting of a radiation-refractory solitary plasmacytoma or progression to multiple myeloma.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primary Amyloidosis</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition <span class="p">Amyloidosis is a heterogenous group of rare disorders characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in soft tissues. Nearly 30 different amyloidogenic proteins have been implicated; herein we focus exclusively on AL amyloidosis, where a monoclonal PCD results in the formation of amyloidogenic kappa or lambda light chains.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology <span class="p">AL amyloidosis is extremely rare, with only 10 patients diagnosed per 1,000,000 person-years. It coexists with multiple myeloma in 10% of cases.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">Presenting symptoms may be diverse given the range of organs potentially involved in AL amyloidosis. Symptoms may include fatigue,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dyspnea, edema, or neuropathy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation <span class="p">History may reveal fatigue, dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea suggestive of heart failure, lower extremity edema, or paresthesias or abnormal bruising. Examination may reveal periorbital purpura, macroglossia, signs of heart failure, hepatosplenomegaly, ecchymosis, or sensory neuropathy. Laboratory evaluation includes CBCs and a comprehensive metabolic profile, serum and urine electrophoresis, and immunofixation and serum-free light chain assay. A 24-hour urine collection for electrophoresis will demonstrate that proteinuria is largely albuminuria rather than light chain excretion. A bone marrow biopsy may demonstrate a small clonal plasma cell population and amyloid deposition.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Echocardiography or cardiac MRI may demonstrate evidence of cardiac involvement. Serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin-T levels are prognostic and should be obtained. A periumbilical fat pad aspiration may provide the patient with pathologic confirmation of amyloid deposition without subjecting the patient to a more invasive endomyocardial, renal, or hepatic biopsy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathophysiology (classification) <span class="p">Distinguishing AL amyloidosis from other forms of amyloidosis can be challenging; a monoclonal protein may coexist with another form of amyloid. Amyloid typing can be accomplished through direct immunofluorescence microscopy or immunohistochemistry. Staging is based on NT-proBNP levels, troponin-T levels, and serum-free light chain levels.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cardiac involvement portends a particularly poor prognosis, with a median survival of fewer than 6 months in patients with elevated cardiac markers and involved serum light chains. In patients with no high-risk factors, the median survival is nearly 8 years.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management <span class="p">Management of AL amyloidosis is essentially entirely pharmacologic. There is no role for surgery or radiation aside from skeletal issues if there is overlap with multiple myeloma. Treatment is directed at the malignant plasma cell clone. A small minority of patients is eligible for high- dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation and may experience complete responses and long-term survival (&gt; 10 years). The systemic therapeutic options utilized in multiple myeloma have activity in amyloidosis, though some require lower doses for tolerability.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The PCDs share in common a clonal proliferation of plasma cells, which are detectable via a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. MGUS is a premalignant, asymptomatic laboratory finding, which progresses to a malignant disorder at a rate of 1% per year. Solitary plasmacytomas are potentially curable with radiation therapy. Multiple myeloma remains an incurable plasma cell malignancy, but therapeutic options have substantially improved in the past two decades. Amyloidosis remains a therapeutic challenge, though improved risk stratification and the use of novel agents developed in myeloma are improving the landscape.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s258" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Coiffier B, Lepage E, Briere J, et al.

Under normal physiologic conditions, this process is localized to the site of injury and is rapid, dynamic, and highly regulated. Phases of this response include initial formation of the platelet plug following endothelial injury, activation of the coagulation cascade for further hemostatic control, regulation of coagulation by endogenous anticoagulants to limit thrombus formation, and finally, fibrinolysis for thrombus removal.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 96-1. <span class="s5">Thrombus formation may occur at areas of endothelial or vascular wall injury.

Following activation by collagen, laminin, microfibrils, and other elements in the exposed subendothelium, platelets are activated and bind to von Willebrand factor (VWF) and fibrinogen via the platelet glycoprotein 1b- alpha and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (also referred as integrin αIIbβ<span class="s11">3</span>), respectively. This leads to enhanced platelet adhesion and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aggregation, resulting in a platelet plug.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Coagulation Cascade</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the clotting cascade is a complex series of pathways, several key events are briefly reviewed here. Classically, the coagulation cascade has been divided into the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, as illustrated in <span class="s1">Figure 96-2</span>. In recent years, investigators have proposed a cell-based model of coagulation that occurs on the cell surface in four overlapping steps: (1) initiation, (2) amplification, (3) propagation, and (4) termination (<span class="s1">Table 96- 1</span>). The primary event for initiation of the clotting cascade and subsequent thrombus formation is interactions of activated factor VII (FVIIa) with exposed tissue factor, an integral membrane glycoprotein, at areas of endothelial or tissue injury. The TF-FVIIa complex (also known as the extrinsic tenase complex) then activates factor IX (FIX) and factor X (FX).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Activated factor X (FXa) converts a small amount of factor II (FII, also known as prothrombin) to thrombin (FIIa). The small amount of thrombin generated during the initiation phase then activates platelets, factor V (FV), factor VIII (FVIII), and factor XI (FXI) (amplification phase). During the propagation phase, activated FXI (FXIa) generates activated FIX (FIXa), which binds to activated (FVIIIa) to form the intrinsic tenase complex. This complex (FIXa:FVIIIa) results in large production of FXa, which in combination with its cofactor, FVa, forms the prothrombinase complex (FXa:FVa), which cleaves prothrombin to thrombin. The efficiency of both the intrinsic tenase complex and prothrombinase complex is enhanced by their co-localization on the surface of activated platelets recruited to the site of endothelial or tissue injury, resulting in a burst of thrombin formation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thrombin then converts fibrinogen to fibrin and overlapping fibrin strands are cross-linked and stabilized by activated factor XIII (FXIIIa).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:47.2pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>KEY PHASES OF THE CELL-BASED MODEL OF COAGULATION<span class="s21">A</span></p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 96-2. <span class="s5">The clotting cascade is a complex series of pathways and key events.

The primary event for initiation of the extrinsic pathway is the interaction between activated factor VII (FVIIa) and exposed tissue factor (TF), often at areas of endothelial or tissue injury. The intrinsic pathway begins with activation of factor XII, driving subsequent activation of factors XI, IX, and X. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways result in the conversion of prothrombin (FII) to thrombin (FIIa), in the final common pathway. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and overlapping fibrin strands are cross-linked and stabilized by activated factor XIII (FXIIIa), resulting in stable thrombus formation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><ul id="l16"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Understand how aging alters hemostatic pathways to increase the risk of both bleeding and thrombosis.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Review the evaluation of older adults with bleeding disorders.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Understand the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in older adults.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Review the strategies to reduce bleeding risk in older adults on anticoagulation.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><div class="textbox" style="border:1.5pt solid #D46B38;display:block;min-height:249.0pt;width:456.0pt;"><p class="s249" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><ol id="l17"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">The risk of bleeding rises with age and is most commonly due to acquired bleeding disorders and disorders of platelet number or function.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">Aging is associated with an increased risk of VTE.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are safe and effective in carefully selected older adults for the treatment of VTE.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s250" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">A careful consideration of the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation in older adults is integral to the selection and management of oral anticoagulants in this high-risk population.</p></li></ol></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Endogenous anticoagulants, including antithrombin (AT), protein C, protein S, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), act to limit coagulation at the site of injury.

For example, bleeding due primarily to disorders of coagulation factors may be seen in older patients with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver disease, acquired hemophilia with inhibitors to FVIII, acquired von Willebrand syndrome, or due to anticoagulant use. Disorders in older adults that may primarily affect platelet number and/or function include immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), chronic kidney disease, myeloproliferative neoplasms, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, and use of antiplatelet agents. The precise incidence and prevalence of these vary depending on the patient and clinical situation studied. Some of these disorders are described in more detail below.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition, and while still incompletely understood, aging itself—devoid of any comorbid influences or anticoagulant/antiplatelet use—has been associated with dysregulation of coagulation factors, fibrinolytic proteins, and activation molecules, which increases bleeding risk. Conversely, the plasma concentrations of many coagulation factors increase with aging.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While these age-related changes are not uniform, the net effect seemingly results in a tendency toward thrombosis, rather than bleeding. For example, plasma fibrinogen levels, which correlate with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increase with age, with an approximate 10 mg/dL incremental rise per decade in healthy subjects. Similarly, vWF levels increase approximately 10% to 20% per decade of life and are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Components of the fibrinolytic pathway are also altered in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plasma levels of PAI-1, the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis, increase with aging, resulting in an age-dependent decrease in fibrinolytic activity. Age- related increases of plasmin-antiplasmin complex and <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer have also been reported suggesting enhanced hyperfibrinolysis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation and Diagnosis</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The initial steps to evaluating bleeding in older adults, like many assessments in medical practice, begin with a careful history and physical examination. Identifying and integrating key components of the patient’s history and physical examination with laboratory data allows providers to more precisely diagnose the underlying etiology of a bleeding diathesis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients should be asked about the initial onset and site of bleeding, prior bleeding episodes (spontaneous and/or postsurgery or trauma), a history of iron deficiency anemia, prior blood transfusions, and a history of heavy menstrual bleeding and/or postpartum hemorrhage (in women).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The presence of other family members with similar bleeding tendencies, particularly in the presence of bleeding that began after birth or during childhood, may suggest an inherited bleeding diathesis. A thorough medication history, including the use of anticoagulants, herbal agents, and over-the-counter (OTC) products, should be obtained. Patients may need to be asked specifically about the use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatories, or other OTC antiplatelet agents. To assess for the possibility of dietary vitamin K deficiency, providers should inquire about the patient’s dietary habits, and whether there have been any changes recently to the diet.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physical Examination</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The physical examination is typically normal, but can vary considerably. Petechiae (small capillary hemorrhages most commonly seen on the legs), epistaxis or gingival bleeding may be seen if there is a disorder of platelet number/function or blood vessels. Older adults with an acquired coagulation disorder can present with large, palpable ecchymoses, soft tissue hematomas, hemarthrosis, and extensive postprocedural bleeding.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span style=" color: #B8422E;">Laboratory Evaluation of Coagulation Pathways in Older Adults </span>Laboratory evaluation includes routine tests available through most laboratories as well as more specialized tests that may require a reference laboratory and the expertise of a hematologist for interpretation. General screening tests include a platelet count, hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The PT assay measures the function of the extrinsic and common pathways (see <span class="s1">Figure 96-2</span>) and detects deficiencies in the vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors: factors II, VII, IX, and X. If a deficiency in factor VII is</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">suspected, the PT is the most sensitive test available. The aPTT measures components of the intrinsic and common pathways and can detect deficiencies of—or inhibitors to—factors II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII (see <span class="s1">Figure 96-2</span>). Both the PT and aPTT can also be prolonged in patients with fibrinogen disorders. Examination of any abnormalities in the PT and/or aPTT can help guide clinicians as to the differential diagnostic and appropriate management steps (<span class="s1">Table 96-2</span>). Other routine testing (eg, liver or renal function panels, peripheral smears, DIC panel, mixing study etc.) may be indicated depending on the patient’s clinical presentation, history, and physical examination.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:65.2pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>PATTERNS AND EVALUATION OF A PROLONGED PROTHROMBIN TIME (PT) AND/OR ACTIVATED PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME (APTT)<span class="s21">*</span></p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Causes of a prolonged PT with a normal aPTT <span class="p">Causes include warfarin or other vitamin K antagonist (VKA) use, vitamin K deficiency, systemic heparin exposure, factor VII deficiency (inherited or acquired), early liver disease, and in some early cases of DIC. PT prolongation is commonly seen in older hospitalized patients who, unable to eat or have reduced dietary intake of food rich in vitamin K, become deficient in vitamin K.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Causes of a normal PT with a prolonged aPTT <span class="p">Causes include anticoagulant use (eg, heparin), deficiencies in factor VIII and/or VWF (hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease), factor IX (hemophilia B), and factor XI (hemophilia C). The use of subcutaneous heparin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is the most common cause for an isolated prolonged aPTT in hospitalized patients. Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder affecting up to 1% of the general population and typically presents with mucocutaneous bleeds (epistaxis, heavy menstrual bleed, easy bruising, and postpartum hemorrhage). Patients with hemophilia usually present in childhood or young adulthood with recurrent soft tissue and joint bleeding and postprocedural bleeding. Factor XI deficiency has a more variable bleeding history, often following surgical procedures.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A prolonged aPTT may also be due to the presence of a circulating acquired inhibitor. The most common acquired inhibitor is the lupus</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">anticoagulant, although this inhibitor causes thrombosis instead of bleeding. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune disorder, with an incidence of approximately 1.5 cases per million per year, that is caused by the production of IgG autoantibodies against endogenous FVIII. It is predominantly a disease of older adults (median age 64–78), but can be associated with malignancies, rheumatological conditions, and pregnancy in younger patients. In up to 50% of patients, there may be no underlying, identifiable etiology. Older adults presenting with an acute onset of subcutaneous bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, or muscle bleeding without a history of trauma or prior known bleeding diathesis should prompt evaluation for AHA as it is associated with a high mortality rate of more than 20% if diagnosis is delayed or misdiagnosed.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Causes of a prolonged PT and aPTT <span class="p">Patients with prolongation of both the PT and aPTT should be suspected of having either an inherited disorder of the common pathway or an acquired disorder that affects the intrinsic, extrinsic, and/or common pathways in combination. In older adults, the most common causes of a prolonged PT and aPTT include supratherapeutic anticoagulation with a VKA or anticoagulation bridging therapy with a VKA and heparin that occurs during the initial treatment of acute VTE. Rarely, accidental rodenticide (brodifacoum) poisoning is a cause for significantly prolonged PT and aPTT. Other possible causes include end-stage liver disease, DIC, or administration of systemic fibrinolytic agents (eg, tPA). Additional diagnostic measures in this setting may include measurements of fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation products.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Abnormal Platelet Number in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The normal half-life of circulating platelets in healthy humans is 8 to 10 days. Any process that disrupts this, leading to reductions in platelet number, may increase the risk of, or cause, bleeding in older adults. Quantitative disorders of platelet number in older adults are numerous and some of the more common of these are outlined in <span class="s1">Table 96-3</span>. Broadly, the causes of thrombocytopenia in older adults can be due to decreased platelet production, increased platelet destruction or consumption, increased platelet sequestration, dilutional effects, and spurious thrombocytopenia.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox"

style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Decreased production of platelets is most often encountered in patients with disorders that impair bone marrow thrombopoiesis. These disorders commonly include nutrient deficiencies, myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute or chronic infectious syndromes. These are particularly common in older adults. For example, vitamin B<span class="s11">12</span> and folate deficiency can be found in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">up to 24% and 10% of older adults, respectively. Similarly the median age at diagnosis for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes exceeds 65 in most studies, with an onset of disease earlier than 50 being very uncommon.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, older adults are at markedly increased risk of infection from bacterial, viral, and fungal causes—many of which may result in bone marrow suppression and associated thrombocytopenia. Many of these disorders are covered in more detail in other chapters within this book. Increased destruction or consumption can be a result of an autoimmune process, sepsis or an accelerated, antibody-mediated clearance from medications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Immune thrombocytope nia </span>ITP is an autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100 × 10<span class="s22">9</span>/L) and occurs as a result of platelet autoantibodies causing platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. It has an incidence of 2 to 5 per 100,000 and increases with age.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Primary ITP is diagnosed in the absence of other causes or disorders that may be associated with thrombocytopenia. The clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from incidental asymptomatic thrombocytopenia discovered on an annual physical examination to life-threatening bleeding events. Patients typically come to clinical attention when they present with mild petechial or purpuric lesions on the extremities and epistaxis. This</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">usually occurs when the platelet count is less than 30 × 10<span class="s22">9</span>/L but many patients remain asymptomatic even in the 10 to 30 × 10<span class="s22">9</span>/L range.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">Although there is no test that can reliably diagnose primary ITP, the</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evaluation in older adults should include a thorough history and physical, complete blood cell count, reticulocyte count, comprehensive metabolic panel, peripheral blood smear, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C serology. The peripheral blood smear is usually normal except</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for the identification of low numbers of platelets with occasional large- appearing platelets. Depending on the history, other diagnostic tests can be helpful in excluding other potential etiologies of the thrombocytopenia. A bone marrow examination is not routinely required but may be undertaken in selected patients if there is other unexplained cytopenia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For adults with newly diagnosed primary ITP (diagnosed within the preceding 3 months) and a platelet count of less than 30 × 10<span class="s22">9</span>/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, first-line treatment includes either prednisone (0.5–2.0 mg/kg per day) or dexamethasone (40 mg</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">per day for 4 days). Given the potential side-effects of corticosteroids, especially in older adults, close monitoring of the patient for hypertension, hyperglycemia, insomnia, depression, gastric irritation, myopathy, and osteoporosis is recommended.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Secondary ITP </span>Secondary ITP is defined as any form of ITP other than primary. This includes drug-induced thrombocytopenia, which is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in older adults. While the timing, severity, and duration of drug-induced thrombocytopenia can vary substantially, thrombocytopenia is usually evident within the first week of initiation of the causative drug (<span class="s1">Figure 96-3</span>). Common drugs known to definitely or probably cause thrombocytopenia are shown in <span class="s1">Table 96-4</span><a href="http://www.ouhsc.edu/platelets/ditp.html)" class="s13" target="_blank">, and an exhaustive list of drugs linked to low platelet counts can be accessed online (</a><a href="http://www.ouhsc.edu/platelets/ditp.html)" class="a" target="_blank">http://www.ouhsc.edu/platelets/ditp.html</a><a href="http://www.fda.gov/medwatch" class="s13" target="_blank">).

Antibodies targeting platelet factor 4 increase platelet activation and consumption, activating the coagulation cascade, with resultant arterial and venous thrombi. HIT is associated with morbidity and mortality if undiagnosed and not treated promptly. The diagnosis of HIT can be challenging and providers are encouraged to use validated clinical prediction tools, such as the 4T Score or the HIT Expert Probability Score, in combination with the results of serologic testing and/or functional platelet assays.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Acute and chronic infections, including hepatitis C, HIV, influenza, and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, may also cause secondary ITP, although precise mechanisms and pathways remain incompletely understood. In some of these infectious syndromes, thrombocytopenia can also result from ineffective thrombopoiesis as a result of bone marrow infiltration and/or megakaryocyte infection. Finally, secondary ITP can also be a complication of rheumatologic and autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, IgA deficiency, and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonautoimmune thrombocytope nia <span class="p">In addition to immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, low platelet counts in older adults can be the result of other nonimmune causes. One of the most commonly encountered causes is spurious thrombocytopenia, also referred to as pseudothrombocytopenia, being identified in about 0.1% of all blood samples in adults. Spurious thrombocytopenia is due to exogenous platelet clumping in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which is found within some vacutainer tubes. This can be identified by examining the blood film for platelet clumping and repeating a platelet count using blood drawn into an alternative anticoagulant such as citrate buffer. In addition, enhanced platelet consumption can occur in processes such as DIC and thrombotic microangiopathies such as thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura. Dilutional thrombocytopenia may be seen in trauma patients who have undergone</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">massive fluid resuscitation protocols that include large number of packed red blood cells transfusions.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Abnormal Platelet Function in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bleeding in older adults may also occur due to inhibition of normal platelet functions (eg, activation, adhesion, and aggregation) that impairs hemostasis. Traditional antiplatelet agents, including aspirin, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatories, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, dipyridamole, and cilostazol, may all increase the risk of bleeding in older adults. The relative risk increase for bleeding varies among different agents and between different patients. A number of other medications commonly prescribed to older adults may also inhibit platelet activation or aggregation. These include nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Many of the mechanisms underlying these drugs’ effects on platelet function remain incompletely understood.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Acquired abnormalities of platelet function in older adults may be due to their underlying co-morbidities. Chronic liver disease may cause abnormalities in platelet aggregation even in the absence of absolute thrombocytopenia. Similarly, acute and chronic kidney disease have been associated with various pathophysiologic effects on platelet function, including abnormal platelet aggregation responses to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and epinephrine as well as impaired platelet adhesion.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Background</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are common and, in many cases, preventable causes of in-hospital death. Age and accumulation of comorbidities markedly increase the risk of VTE in older adults. Yet, the diagnosis of VTE remains underrecognized in older adults. Clinical suspicion is essential for a prompt diagnosis in older adults who may have an atypical presentation; autopsy studies demonstrate PE is frequently not suspected, nor identified, despite being a common cause of death in older persons. Anticoagulants are the mainstay of VTE treatment given their substantial risk reductions in VTE recurrence and mortality. However, the benefit of anticoagulants may be offset in older adults by their age-related</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">increased risk of bleeding, as described earlier. Balancing the risks of recurrence with bleeding is important to guide treatment duration.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epidemiology and Pathophysiology</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Incidence of VTE <span class="p">In the general population, the annual incidence of VTE approximates 2 to 3 in 1000 persons and appears to be increasing over time. Notably, the incidence rises with age with an approximate 7 per 1000 persons in those over the age of 70.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk factors <span class="p">One or more clinical risk factors are usually identifiable at the time of VTE diagnosis in older adults. In patients presenting with a first episode of VTE, recent hospitalization is the most common risk factor.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additional known risk factors include recent surgical procedures, malignancy, acute infection, impaired mobility, heart failure exacerbation, chronic lung disease, central venous catheter placement, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, hormonal therapy, and prior VTE. Major orthopedic procedures such as elective hip and knee arthroplasty, or surgical repair of a hip fracture, are additional major VTE risk factors in older adults. Less commonly occurring risk factors include antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, HIT and inherited thrombophilias (factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A gene mutation, protein C or S deficiency, AT deficiency).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Aging is considered a nonmodifiable risk factor; as patients age they accumulate VTE risk factors with additive risk. Impaired mobility, malignancy, and medical comorbidities (ie, heart failure, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, obesity) are common in older adults and highlight the importance of VTE awareness in this patient population.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Pathophysiology of venous thrombosis </span>Venous thrombi are comprised of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets enmeshed in a fibrin lattice (see <span class="s1">Figure 96-1</span>). The Virchow’s triad of vascular endothelial injury, impaired blood flow (stasis), and hypercoagulability predisposes to venous thrombus formation. Typically, venous thrombi form in an area of blood vessel injury or venous stasis. Endothelial injury activates the clotting cascade shifting the natural balance between blood coagulation and fibrinolysis toward thrombus formation. Vessel injury from inflammation, surgery, trauma, or malignancy exposes subendothelial proteins, specifically tissue factor and collagen.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Tissue factor precipitates initial thrombin generation and subsequent</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">coagulation cascade (see <span class="s1">Figure 96-2</span>). Exposed collagen acts as binding sites for platelet activation and aggregation. Venous stasis lengthens the time coagulation factors are exposed to sites of vascular injury, further propagating clot formation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Impaired venous blood flow is attributable to several factors commonly found in older adults. Reduced mobility leads to venous pooling in the legs, development of venous varicosities, and associated venous valvular incompetence. The sinuses behind venous valve cusps represent particularly vulnerable areas for thrombus formation due to disturbed blood flow and stasis. Polycythemia from dehydration, chronic hypoxemia or a myeloproliferative neoplasm, or hypergammaglobulinemia related to chronic inflammation or multiple myeloma results in blood hyperviscosity, further altering blood flow and increasing thrombotic risk. Venous outflow obstruction from incompletely resolved DVT or extrinsic venous compression from solid tumors may worsen venous stasis and promote thrombosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Blood coagulation is carefully regulated by inhibitors of thrombin generation and subsequent fibrin formation and the fibrinolytic system. Disruptions in these counterregulatory systems may be inherited or acquired. The circulating natural anticoagulants, including proteins C and S, and AT are essential to prevent unabated fibrin formation. Inherited proteins C and S, and AT deficiencies are uncommon, occurring in 0.02% to 0.3% of the population. The most commonly inherited thrombophilia is factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation, with a prevalence of 5% in an unselected Caucasian population. A point mutation in the FV gene at amino acid 506 (substitution of arginine to glutamine) renders FVa less susceptible to inactivation by activated protein C, which leads to a three- to fivefold increased risk of VTE. Even so, due to incomplete penetrance of FVL, many individuals with the mutation will never develop a VTE. The prothrombin <i>G20210A </i>gene mutation, the second most commonly inherited thrombophilia, is a point mutation in the FII gene that results in a 30% increase in prothrombin levels. It occurs in about 2% of an unselected White population and confers a threefold increased risk of VTE.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Acquired thrombophilias in older adults include antiphospholipid syndrome, HIT, hormone replacement therapy, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and malignancy. Antiphospholipid syndrome is defined by persistent circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and the presence of arterial or</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">venous thrombosis, or pregnancy-related complications. The clinically significant aPL are immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) anticardiolipin antibodies, IgG or IgM β<span class="s11">2</span>-glycoprotein I antibodies, or the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lupus anticoagulant. These antibodies target multiple sites resulting in monocyte, platelet, complement, and endothelial cell activation; tissue factor production; and cytokine production, contributing to arterial and venous thrombotic events, thrombocytopenia, pregnancy complications, and cardiac valvular disease. aPL titers at the time of an acute thrombotic event may be transiently positive. As such, guidelines recommend that an initial positive aPL test be repeated after at least 12 weeks to confirm a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. The prevalence of aPL increases with age, yet many patients remain asymptomatic without any evidence of arterial or venous thrombosis. As the clinical significance of aPL in older adults remains uncertain, routine screening is not recommended.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Hormone replacement therapy to treat postmenopausal symptoms increases VTE risk nearly threefold, especially in the first year of use. Myeloproliferative neoplasms including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are frequently associated with both arterial and venous thrombosis. These patients, especially those who have the gain-of-function mutation of the Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) enzyme, the <i>JAK2 </i>V617F mutation, are particularly prone to thrombosis of the splanchnic veins (hepatic, portal, splenic, and mesenteric).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with malignancy have a four- to sevenfold increased risk of VTE, with up to 20% of all VTEs occurring in cancer patients. The molecular mechanisms of cancer-associated thrombosis remain an area of research. Cancer cells can directly activate the coagulation cascade and platelets through the expression and secretion of tissue factor, platelet agonists, inflammatory cytokines, and PAI-1. In addition, many anticancer therapies are prothrombotic themselves (eg, lenalidomide, cisplatin, L- asparaginase), thus further promoting thrombus formation.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Presentation</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Acute venous thromboe mbolism <span class="p">Venous thrombi in the legs may originate in the superficial (greater and lesser saphenous veins) or deep veins. For the deep veins, involvement of the popliteal, femoral, or iliac vein is classified as a proximal DVT, whereas a distal DVT involves the calf veins only (gastrocnemius, soleal, peroneal, or posterior tibial). The deep intramuscular</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">calf veins are frequent sites of thrombus initiation; distal DVTs represent up to 50% of leg DVTs. When confined to the calf veins, patients may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. Proximal leg DVT typically results in asymmetrical leg swelling, diffuse tenderness, erythema, and engorgement of collateral veins if the thrombus is occlusive. These symptoms of DVT can occur suddenly or subacute over days to weeks. In the upper extremities, the deep venous system includes the brachial, axillary, subclavian, and brachiocephalic vein, whereas the superficial veins include the antecubital, cephalic, and basilic veins. Patients with upper extremity DVT can present similarly as leg DVT with asymmetrical arm swelling, pain, and erythema.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Symptoms of acute superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the upper and lower extremities are easily recognized by localized tenderness over the affected veins, swelling, erythema, warmth, and often a palpable thrombus within the vein. PE can range from asymptomatic, to mild chest discomfort and dyspnea, to severe pleuritic pain and breathlessness, or sudden death with massive PE. Additional signs and symptoms include hemoptysis, cough, tachypnea, tachycardia, syncope, fatigue, and hypoxemia.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chronic venous thromboe mbolism <span class="p">Although acute VTE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, chronic symptoms may develop following an acute event. Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is the most frequent complication of DVT, affecting 20% to 50% of patients 1 to 2 years after the event. Due to chronic venous occlusion from incompletely cleared thrombus and incompetent venous valves that were damaged by the acute DVT, patients with PTS present with chronic symptoms of leg pain, heaviness, swelling, skin induration, hyperpigmentation, and venous ulcerations in the most severe cases (5%–10%). In the United States, the annual cost of PTS treatment is estimated at ≈$7000 per patient per year.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Given the prevalence and chronicity of the disease, PTS is associated with a large socioeconomic burden to patients and the health care system.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a complication of PE with a reported incidence ranging from 0.4% to 6.2%. CTEPH is characterized by chronically occluded pulmonary arteries, which is thought to result from nonresolving pulmonary emboli. These patients typically present with chronic dyspnea and fatigue. If left untreated, it can lead to right heart failure and death.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Clinical prediction models </span>Asymmetrical leg swelling, pain, erythema, and warmth should prompt evaluation for DVT. However, clinical assessment alone cannot accurately identify DVT, and it is estimated that of all patients evaluated, only 20% have the disease. The integration of clinical prediction models with laboratory assays and noninvasive imaging allows for accurate DVT diagnosis in the majority of patients. Several clinical scoring systems exist (eg, Wells, Oudega, Hamilton, Geneva) that have been validated in the outpatient adult population for accuracy and reproducibility. The Wells DVT model remains the best validated and most utilized for determining the likelihood of DVT. Points are assigned based on clinical signs and symptoms, medical and surgical history, and clinician judgment regarding the likelihood of DVT (<span class="s1">Table 96-5</span>). Using a dichotomized score, patients are stratified into two pretest probability categories: DVT likely or DVT unlikely. The subjectivity involved with the clinician estimating DVT likelihood is a major criticism of the Wells DVT model. However, several studies have shown that when pretest probability is objectively assessed, the accuracy of DVT diagnosis is enhanced, minimizing unnecessary testing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>WELLS DVT MODEL—A DVT CLINICAL PROBABILITY SCORE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Laboratory testing </span>D<span class="s386">-Dimer is a cross-linked fibrin degradation product generated when mature thrombus is cleaved by plasmin.

In addition, multiple </span>D<span class="s386">-dimer assays exist and there is a lack of standardization with the assays, with some assays highly sensitive and some less so. Also, as </span>D<span class="s386">-dimer levels increase with age, older adults are more likely to have false- positive results, which lead to lower specificity for DVT diagnosis in the aging population.

A positive <span class="s260">D</span>- dimer result in patients with a low clinical probability for DVT necessitates further imaging to safely exclude DVT. Patients with a high clinical probability (DVT likely) should initially undergo compression ultrasonography (CUS); if negative, then a <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer should be measured. If the <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer result is negative, then DVT is essentially ruled out, but if the <span class="s260">D</span>- dimer is positive, then repeat CUS in 1 week is recommended to safely exclude DVT, especially if the initial imaging was not whole-leg CUS.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 96-4. <span class="s5">Diagnostic management of outpatients with suspected DVT using the Wells DVT Model.

Whole-leg CUS involves imaging the entire venous network from the common femoral vein distally to the deep calf veins with external pressure applied through the ultrasound transducer to visualize complete vessel collapse. Incompressibility or partial vessel collapse anywhere along the venous network is the hallmark of an intraluminal filling defect, representative of a thrombus. Supplementary imaging techniques including color Doppler and augmentation (manually squeezing the limb) allow visualization of venous blood flow, or the lack thereof, suggestive of thrombus. Benefits of whole-leg CUS are the ability to image proximal and distal veins in a single study, eliminating the need for follow-up imaging.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, whole-leg CUS is time-consuming and highly operator dependent. A simplified, two-point CUS involves only imaging the common femoral and popliteal veins. Patients with low clinical probability (DVT unlikely) and a positive <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer result can safely forego anticoagulation therapy following a negative two-point CUS. However, patients with a high clinical probability (DVT likely) and a positive <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer should undergo serial two-point CUS approximately 1 week apart to safely exclude proximal DVT.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While whole-leg CUS is a more comprehensive examination and frequently identifies distal DVT, the majority of distal DVT will not extend proximally and will resolve spontaneously. The overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant findings may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in older patients.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Magnetic Resonance Venography <span class="p">Magnetic resonance (MR) venography of the leg is a sensitive test to detect DVTs. However, it is not recommended for routine use as it is expensive and not widely available. It is a valuable alternative test for those in whom CUS are inconclusive or in whom CUS is not feasible, such as morbidly obese patients.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical prediction models <span class="p">The most common symptoms of acute PE reported in older adults can be nonspecific and include dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and chest pain. Symptoms of DVT (leg pain and swelling) are present in more than 40% of patients with acute PE, and simultaneous DVT is identified in up to 60% of patients diagnosed with a PE. Clinical signs including rales, accentuated pulmonic second heart sound, and jugular venous distension may be identified at presentation. Similar to DVT, these signs and symptoms are</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">insufficient to diagnose PE, but are useful to estimate the clinical probability and guide additional testing.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Probability estimation of PE can be accomplished through several clinical prediction models, including the Wells or Geneva scores, or even clinical gestalt. The Wells score for PE has been validated in the outpatient adult population and utilizes different clinical signs and symptoms than the DVT prediction model, although still incorporating the subjective assessment of likelihood of PE, a potential limitation. The Wells PE model stratifies patients as “likely” or “unlikely” (<span class="s1">Table 96-6</span>) and, when combined with a <span class="s260">D</span>- dimer assay and computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), provides an effective diagnostic strategy for PE.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-6 <span class="s3">■ </span>WELLS PE MODEL—A PE CLINICAL PROBABILITY SCORE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Laboratory testing </span>Similar to its role in DVT evaluation, a negative <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">result combined with a low clinical probability (PE unlikely) can safely exclude the diagnosis of PE. Conversely, a positive <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer result must be followed up with an imaging study. The use of an age-adjusted <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer threshold has been prospectively validated in outpatients 50 years or older and was found to increase the diagnostic utility of the test. The age-adjusted threshold is equal to age (in years) × 10 μg/L (using <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer assays with a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cutoff of 500 μg/L).

Identifiable signs of PE on chest radiography include oligemia (Westermark sign), a focal area of decreased perfusion of pulmonary vessels distal to the PE; wedge-shaped pleural-based opacity (Hampton hump) representative of a pulmonary infarct; and hilar enlargement, due to thrombus impaction and pulmonary artery engorgement.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ventilation-Perfusion Lung Scanning <span class="p">Prior to widespread adoption of computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning was the most reliable noninvasive imaging modality to diagnose PE. Many factors have contributed to its declining use including lack of availability at some institutions, time needed to perform an examination, and frequently encountered nonspecific test results. However, V/Q lung scanning remains clinically useful in older patients with renal insufficiency or contrast allergy, or when attempting to minimize external beam radiation to the chest of young women.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In suspected PE, the performance characteristics of lung scanning improve when paired with a normal chest radiograph and pretest probability assessment. For example, a patient with high clinical probability (PE likely) and a high probability scan has a 96% likelihood of having PE, whereas a low clinical probability (PE unlikely) paired with a low probability scan has a 4% likelihood of having PE; a normal perfusion scan essentially excludes PE. Unfortunately, the majority of patients presenting with suspected PE will have nondiagnostic imaging and require additional evaluation. The increased prevalence of abnormal chest radiographs and high clinical probability of PE in older adults further limit the utility of V/Q lung scanning.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography <span class="p">Widespread availability and technological advances have made CTPA the primary imaging modality for suspected PE, except when contraindicated (severe renal insufficiency or contrast allergy). The advent of multidetector CT scanners’ spatial and temporal resolution has improved, increasing the sensitivity for PE diagnosis. Although the increased use of CTPA and the addition of more</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">detectors have resulted in greater recognition of PE, a corresponding decline in mortality has not been seen, raising doubts about the clinical significance of subsegmental PE.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">To minimize the number of unnecessary imaging studies and potential overtreatment of clinically insignificant PE, CTPA should be paired with clinical prediction models and <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer testing. Outpatients with low clinical probability (PE unlikely) and a negative <span class="s260">D</span>-dimer can safely avoid further imaging. Outpatients with a low clinical probability for PE and a positive <span class="s260">D</span>- dimer test and any patient with a high clinical probability for PE (PE likely) need to undergo imaging studies.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Additional benefits of CTPA over other imaging modalities are its abilities to simultaneously diagnose PE and detect right ventricular dilation (useful in risk stratification) and to identify alternative diagnoses when PE is not present, which is especially useful in older adults with atypical presentations.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Home treatment vs hospital treatment <span class="p">For patients with newly diagnosed uncomplicated DVT, home treatment is generally recommended. As compared to hospital treatment, treating patients with DVT at home was demonstrated to reduce the risk of PE, subsequent DVT, and major bleeding. However, older patients with multiple comorbidities that may require hospitalization, or at high risk for anticoagulant-related bleeding, may be more appropriately treated in the hospital. Socioeconomic factors, such as limited financial or home support, may also require hospital treatment for the initial management.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, patients with newly diagnosed PE at low risk for complications may be treated at home effectively and safely. The difficulty is in determining which patients are appropriate for outpatient treatment. The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and simplified PESI, both clinical prediction score for PE severity, are the best-validated scoring systems. Points are assigned based on age, vital signs, and medical history to determine risk of 30-day mortality. Yet, clinical judgement is needed as other factors, including comorbidities, high risk for anticoagulant-related bleeding, and socioeconomic factors, may require inpatient management for the initial phase of treatment.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choice of anticoagulant the rapy <span class="p">Initial VTE treatment requires an anticoagulant with a rapid onset of action to reduce thrombus extension, recurrence, or embolization. This can be accomplished through parenteral anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or the use of selected direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (rivaroxaban and apixaban).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">UFH use is declining for VTE treatment; however, it remains useful in patients with renal insufficiency or high bleeding risk where rapid reversal may be needed, conditions commonly encountered in older adults. UFH may be administered as a continuous infusion or subcutaneously in doses sufficient to achieve therapeutic levels. Intravenous administration typically begins with a bolus dose of 80 U/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 18 U/kg/h. Close laboratory monitoring (every 6 hours until stable) is essential to ensure the desired therapeutic effect and to minimize bleeding. Monitoring is done with either the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or an antifactor Xa (anti-Xa) activity assay. Expert consensus recommends a therapeutic heparin range of 0.35 to 0.7 U/mL measured by anti-Xa activity, which is typically 1.5 to 2.5 times the control aPTT. Alternatively, and less commonly used, short courses of fixed-dose subcutaneous UFH (333 U/kg load, then 250 U/kg every 12 hours) may be safely used in some patients for initial treatment and without laboratory monitoring.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Subcutaneous LMWH has more predictable pharmacology than UFH infusions. This allows outpatient VTE treatment with fixed, weight-based doses without routine laboratory monitoring in select patients. When compared to UFH for VTE treatment, LMWH is associated with fewer thrombotic complications, less major bleeding, and a mortality benefit.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) was the cornerstone of VTE treatment for nearly 60 years, until the introduction of DOACs. Warfarin initiation must be overlapped with a parenteral anticoagulant (UFH or LMWH) for a minimum of 5 days, and until the international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than 2.0 for at least 24 hours, due to its delayed anticoagulant effect. Warfarin’s narrow therapeutic window (INR 2.0–3.0) and numerous food and drug interactions necessitate routine INR monitoring for the duration of therapy. Close INR monitoring is especially important in older adults. Aging is associated with alterations in some vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors, and older adults typically have increased sensitivity to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. In</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">addition, older adults usually have a higher prevalence of polypharmacy which can increase the risk of major bleeding.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">DOACs represent a new class of anticoagulants targeting specific sites within the coagulation cascade (<span class="s1">Table 96-7</span>). Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor that competitively binds to soluble and fibrin-bound thrombin, inhibiting the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and subsequent thrombus formation. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are factor Xa inhibitors that selectively block the active site of factor Xa, inhibiting the coagulation cascade without the use of a cofactor (antithrombin). Both dabigatran and edoxaban require an initial 5-day course of parenteral anticoagulant (UFH or LMWH) prior to DOAC initiation, whereas rivaroxaban and apixaban can be initiated immediately. Although there are no dedicated randomized trials in the older adult population, a meta-analysis of data extracted from the landmark phase III trials (RE-COVER I-II, EINSTEIN DVT-PE, AMPLIFY and HOKUSAI) for a subgroup of patient 75 years or older demonstrated that DOACs were more effective in preventing VTE recurrence (risk ratio for recurrence 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38–0.82) and were associated with a reduced risk of major bleeding (relative risk ratio 0.39, 95% CI 0.17–0.90) compared to warfarin. Additional appealing attributes of the DOACs compared to warfarin include fewer drug interactions and more predictable pharmacokinetics, thus eliminating the need for routine laboratory monitoring.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>DOAC DOSING FOR MANAGEMENT OF VTE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thrombolytic the rapy <span class="p">Given the high mortality in patients presenting with acute PE with hemodynamic compromise, defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease in systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg from baseline, the use of systemic thrombolysis may be warranted. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is an alternative for patients with an intermediate risk for bleeding as the total dose of thrombolytic delivered by CDT is lower. The role of thrombolytics for patients with submassive PE (evidence of right ventricular dysfunction without hemodynamic compromise) is less clear. The PEITHO study found a reduction in hemodynamic decompensation without a mortality benefit, but at the cost of marked increases in major bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Particularly, patients older than 75 years suffered significantly more major bleeding events than younger patients. Additionally, as age greater than 75 is considered a relative contraindication to thrombolytic therapy in general, thrombolytics currently have a limited role in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Typically, CDT of acute proximal DVT to reduce the risk of PTS is not recommended. In the ATTRACT trial, the addition of CDT to anticoagulation for acute proximal DVT did not result in a lower risk of PTS (risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.11), but did result in a higher risk of major bleeding within 10 days (1.7% vs 0.3% of patients). A subgroup analysis of patients with acute iliofemoral DVT in the ATTRACT trial also showed no difference in PTS occurrence at 2 years but found that CDT led to greater</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reduction in leg pain and swelling, and improved quality of life. In contrast, the CaVenT study found that patients with iliofemoral DVT and low bleeding risk who underwent CDT demonstrated an absolute risk reduction of 14.4% in development of PTS at 2 years. No difference in clinical symptoms was evident at 6 months. This highlights the importance of proper patient selection as CDT may be reasonable in selected younger patients at low risk of bleeding with symptomatic iliofemoral DVT. Additionally, as both studies excluded patients older than 75 years, further studies are needed to determine the relative safety and efficacy of these strategies in older adults.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Duration of anticoagulant the rapy <span class="p">The duration of anticoagulant therapy is determined by balancing the thromboembolic risk with the bleeding risk. In general, VTE provoked by a transient (ie, reversible) risk factor such as surgery or trauma is associated with a low risk of recurrence, and a 3-month treatment course is sufficient. VTE without identifiable risk factors (ie, unprovoked) is associated with nearly 20% risk of recurrence at 2 years, and 30% risk of recurrence at 8 years. As such, extended anticoagulant therapy (&gt; 3 months) is reserved for unprovoked VTE with low-moderate bleeding risk and recurrent unprovoked VTE with high bleeding risk. The decision to continue long-term anticoagulant therapy must be periodically revisited (ie, annually) to determine the net clinical benefit, especially in older patients who are at increased risk for VTE and bleeding complications.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anticoagulant Use in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE increase the risk of bleeding. Older adults who are anticoagulated have a 3% to 5% risk per year of having a major bleeding event as compared to younger subjects (1%–2% per year). This relative risk increase depends to some degree among the patient group being studied, the anticoagulant class, and most importantly, the presence or absence of comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, uncontrolled hypertension, a history of bleeding, liver disease, concomitant antiplatelet agent or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and others. This increased bleeding risk presents a challenging clinical dilemma for practitioners as older patients, while having an increased bleeding risk, also have a significantly higher risk of VTE recurrence. As such, a baseline assessment of bleeding risk, measurement of renal and liver function and platelet count, and a thorough medication review are essential prior to anticoagulation initiation and periodically while on anticoagulation.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assessment and Management of Bleeding Risk in Older Adults on Anticoagulants</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Various bleeding risk prediction tools (eg, ACCP risk table, VTE-BLEED, RIETE, HAS-BLED) have been published, and the reader is referred to several recent reviews for more detailed information on the topic. The HAS- BLED score is probably the best validated and most utilized risk estimation tool for major bleeding, particularly for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) treated with VKA (<span class="s1">Table 96-8</span>). Evaluation of HAS-BLED in the VTE population and in patients treated with DOACs has been limited to small cohort studies. Additionally, the HAS-BLED score includes the item “labile INR,” which is not relevant if DOACs are the choice of anticoagulant. As a result, these bleeding risk prediction tools should not be used to exclude patients from anticoagulant therapy, but rather to identify and eliminate modifiable bleeding risk factors (<span class="s1">Table 96-9</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-8 <span class="s3">■ </span>THE HAS-BLED BLEEDING RISK SCORE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-9 <span class="s3">■ </span>MODIFIABLE BLEEDING RISK FACTORS IN OLDER ADULTS PRESCRIBED ANTICOAGULANTS AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE RISK</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Other strategies to reduce the risk of bleeding in older adults prescribed anticoagulants include a thorough medication reconciliation to identify concomitantly prescribed medications that might interact with an anticoagulant or increase the risk of bleeding.

The anticoagulant effect of warfarin can be reversed using vitamin K (takes ~24 hours) or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) (eg, KCentra) if immediate reversal is required. Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to dabigatran with a higher affinity than its affinity to thrombin, thus effectively neutralizing its anticoagulant effect. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 for use in patients treated with dabigatran presenting with life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, or those requiring emergency surgery or urgent procedures. Andexanet alfa, a modified human factor Xa decoy protein that binds and sequesters factor Xa inhibitors, received accelerated FDA approval in 2018 for the reversal of rivaroxaban or apixaban due to life- threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Despite its regulatory approval, andexanet alfa is not yet widely available in hospital formularies due to concerns about its efficacy and financial cost. Given the uncertainty of its clinical benefit, the FDA mandated a postmarketing randomized clinical trial of andexanet alfa against usual care (typically four-factor PCC) that is currently recruiting (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">ClinicalTrials.gov </span>identifier: NCT03661528).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primary VTE Prophylaxis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Extensive clinical practice guidelines have been published by professional societies addressing a wide range of indications for VTE prophylaxis and should be referenced for detailed guidance. In general, all hospitalized patients should be evaluated for VTE prophylaxis on an individualized basis. Clinical scoring systems exist to guide these decisions for medical and surgical patients. For example, in medical patients, the Padua Prediction Score (<span class="s1">Table 96-10</span>) incorporates intrinsic factors and acute physiologic condition, with points assigned on a weighted scale. A cumulative score greater than or equal to 4 points is considered high risk and is associated with a 32-fold increased incidence of VTE compared to a low-risk score, which is less than 4 points. When the VTE risk is high and pharmacologic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">prophylaxis is being considered, bleeding risk must also be estimated. Although, bleeding risk scoring systems to guide VTE prophylaxis are not well developed or validated, active peptic ulcer disease, thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 50 k/μL), and age greater than 85 are considered to carry excessive bleeding risk and may preclude pharmacologic prophylaxis.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 96-10 <span class="s3">■ </span>MODEL FOR DETERMINING A RISK OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM (VTE) IN HOSPITALIZED MEDICAL PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The choice of pharmacologic and/or mechanical prophylaxis depends on the clinical situation and provider assessment.

Mechanical prophylaxis relies on intermittent pneumatic compression devices or graduated compression</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">stockings to minimize venous stasis and is either used in conjunction with pharmacologic agents for high-risk indications (ie, post–total hip/knee arthroplasty or hip fracture surgery) or as a stand alone method when bleeding risk is high and pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Age-related physiologic changes and accumulation of comorbidities increase both the risk of bleeding and VTE in older adults. As anticoagulant therapy remains the cornerstone of VTE treatment, screening for and targeting of modifiable risk factors for major bleeding is essential. Given the advantages of DOACs compared with warfarin, and the availability of DOAC-specific reversal agents, it is anticipated that the use of DOACs in older adults will continue to rise. Dedicated anticoagulation clinics play a valuable role in mitigating the risk of bleeding in older adults prescribed anticoagulants by providing regular follow-up, counseling, and education.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The author acknowledges Dr. Stacy Johnson and Dr. Matthew Rondina for their prior contributions to this chapter in the 7th edition of this textbook.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Anderson DR, Morgano GP, Bennett C, et al.

Clinical manifestations may also be altered, muted, or masked by age-associated comorbid illnesses and increased use of medications. For example, cardiovascular (eg, heart failure and atrial fibrillation) and neurobehavioral (eg, cognitive impairment and depression) manifestations of thyroid disease occur more frequently and are often the most prominent features in older patients compared to younger patients (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 98 </span>for details). Clinically significant endocrinopathies may present with atypical manifestations and physical examination findings may differ in older patients (the best examples are thyroid diseases per <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 98</span>). Older patients with endocrine disorders may present with geriatric syndromes (eg, falls or functional or cognitive impairment) and some disorders occur almost exclusively in older patients, for example,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#D46B38;display:block;min-height:37.5pt;width:321.0pt;"><p class="s251" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Endocrinology and Metabolism</p></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><div class="textbox" style="background:#ECBC9F;display:block;min-height:37.5pt;width:136.5pt;"><p class="s252" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SECTION G</p></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nonketotic diabetic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia and anaplastic thyroid cancer.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Laboratory Confirmation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Confirmation of endocrine diagnoses in older persons relies on laboratory measurements of hormone concentrations. Most clinical studies of endocrine dysfunction in older patients are defined as hormone values above or below reference ranges in healthy young individuals, rather than age-specific ranges. For example, hypogonadism in older men is defined by serum testosterone concentrations below those of healthy young men. In contrast, the distribution of serum thyrotropin concentrations is higher in older persons (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 98</span>), suggesting that the upper limit of thyrotropin concentrations is higher, for example, 7 to 8 mIU/L, (particularly in those 80 years and older) than in younger individuals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><ul id="l19"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Understand the presenting manifestations of common endocrinopathies in older patients.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Describe the initial diagnostic evaluation and fundamentals of management of common endocrinopathies in older patients.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><h3 style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pituitary Disorders</h3><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l20"><li data-list-text="1."><h3 style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Mild hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin 20–50 ng/mL) is common in older people and seldom needs treatment, but primary hypothyroidism should be excluded.</h3></li><li data-list-text="2."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with moderate to severe hyperprolactinemia should be referred to an endocrinologist.</h3></li><li data-list-text="3."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Serum pituitary hormone concentrations may be inappropriately or even slightly elevated in patients with hypopituitarism.</h3></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Identify when to consult and how to optimize the collaboration with endocrinologists.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l21"><li data-list-text="4."><h3 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">Older patients with diabetes insipidus often have concomitant impaired thirst and are best managed in collaboration with an endocrinologist.</h3></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adrenal Disorders</h3><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l22"><li data-list-text="1."><h3 style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Older patients are particularly prone to suffer fragility fractures and sarcopenia due to Cushing syndrome.</h3></li><li data-list-text="2."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">The most common cause of Cushing syndrome in older patients is iatrogenic.</h3></li><li data-list-text="3."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency in older patients is a rapid discontinuation of chronic glucocorticoid therapy.</h3></li><li data-list-text="4."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">The sole or primary manifestation of adrenal insufficiency in older patients may be weakness, weight loss, anorexia, or chronic nausea.</h3></li><li data-list-text="5."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">It is essential that patients with adrenal insufficiency take the equivalent of 60 mg hydrocortisone daily (triple the usual daily replacement dosage) for a febrile illness and are able to administer intramuscular hydrocortisone if they cannot take oral medications due to illness.</h3></li><li data-list-text="6."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Patients on chronic corticosteroid therapy (3 months or more) must have their corticosteroid dosage reduced slowly to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency.

It is important that geriatricians recognize that hormone levels may be affected transiently by illnesses (eg, slight thyrotropin elevation during recovery from acute illness) and medications (eg, suppression of gonadotropin and testosterone levels by opioids). Therefore, it is crucial to repeat hormone testing in older patients</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with mild endocrine laboratory abnormalities when baseline health status is restored fully.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In older patients with clinical endocrine deficiency, the dosage of hormone replacement may be lower than in young patients because the metabolic clearance of some hormones is reduced with aging (eg, thyroid hormone, hydrocortisone, and testosterone). It is important to appreciate that underlying age-related conditions may be worsened by hormone overtreatment (eg, worsening of osteoporosis with excessive glucocorticoid or thyroid hormone therapy). For hormone replacement, starting treatment at slightly lower than full hormone replacement dosages is appropriate (eg, lower dosages of testosterone to avoid erythrocytosis that occurs more frequently with full replacement dosages). Multimorbidity and polypharmacy may predispose older patients to poor medication adherence and adverse drug effects or interactions.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The management of older persons with endocrine disorders should focus on improvement in function and quality of life within the social context of the patient; this might require multidisciplinary care in consultation with an endocrinologist. Some older patients may request hormone therapy (eg, testosterone, growth hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) as a rejuvenation remedy to reverse the symptoms and signs of aging. It is important for geriatricians to dispel this myth, educate patients about realistic goals of treatment, and avoid initiation of hormone therapy trials for mild or subclinical endocrine dysfunction with the false expectation of dramatic clinical improvements.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In this chapter, we review the geriatrician’s approach to the evaluation and management of the most common non-thyroid endocrine disorders that occur in patients 65 years or older. Even when the geriatrician refers a patient to an endocrinologist for recommendations, the geriatrician plays an indispensable role in providing information about the goals of therapy based on the patient’s quality of life, functional status, other comorbidities, and personal/family preferences.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANTERIOR PITUITARY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The two most common anterior pituitary endocrine disorders that geriatricians will encounter or manage are hyperprolactinemia and pituitary</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">incidentalomas. In addition, the geriatrician may occasionally have a patient with an established or new diagnosis of hypopituitarism. The geriatrician should understand the basic management of these disorders and when to consult an endocrinologist.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hyperprolactinemia</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physiology and presentation <span class="p">Prolactin has two established physiologic effects: induction of lactation and suppression of gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary. Lactation requires estrogen, and only premenopausal women typically have high enough circulating estradiol concentrations for lactation. Thus, lactation due to hyperprolactinemia is very rare in men and postmenopausal women. Prolactin is tonically secreted from the anterior pituitary, and it is regulated primarily by negative feedback from dopamine that is secreted by the hypothalamus into the hypothalamic-pituitary portal venous system. Any process that stimulates the nipple or the peri-areolar chest wall (rubbing, suckling, or infectious processes) may induce prolactin release via a neurologic pathway. Finally, exercise, sleep, and acute physiologic or psychological stress may stimulate prolactin secretion and may result in mildly elevated serum prolactin concentrations.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There are three common settings when a geriatrician may encounter hyperprolactinemia in older patients. Older men commonly have low to low- normal serum testosterone concentrations and inappropriately normal serum FSH and LH concentrations, a biochemical pattern consistent with secondary hypogonadism. Serum prolactin is often measured in that setting, and it might be elevated. Older women and men may present with pituitary tumors that are discovered during brain imaging, and evaluation may include measurement of serum prolactin. Finally, serum prolactin is sometimes measured and found to be elevated in some clinical settings when serum prolactin measurement is not indicated (eg, erectile dysfunction without any evidence of endocrinopathy).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology and causes <span class="p">There are not good data on the prevalence of hyperprolactinemia in the general population or in older people, but the overall incidence of hyperprolactinemia appears to be about 0.1 per 100 patient-years in people 65 years or older. The incidence and prevalence appear to be increasing over the past three decades, but that likely reflects increased testing of serum prolactin. The data are based on surveys of patients at higher risk of hyperprolactinemia (eg, cohorts of patients taking</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">psychoactive drugs or retrospective studies of databases that include patients who have had a serum prolactin measured). The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia is similar in older women and men.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The causes of hyperprolactinemia may be categorized by the physiology of prolactin secretion and clearance (<span class="s1">Table 97-1</span>). Conditions that disrupt the normal negative feedback of dopamine on prolactin secretion include antidopaminergic drugs and large pituitary tumors that impinge on the pituitary stalk and pituitary portal venous system. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) also stimulates the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Moderate to severe primary hypothyroidism that results in high portal venous TRH concentrations (and high peripheral circulating thyrotropin [TSH] concentrations) may cause hyperprolactinemia. Because prolactin is cleared from the circulation by the kidney, moderate to severe kidney injury is a cause of hyperprolactinemia. Another cause of decreased clearance of prolactin is the presence of antibodies that aggregate with prolactin; this aggregation of antibodies and prolactin is known as “macroprolactin.” The prevalence of anti-prolactin antibodies and macroprolactinemia is common and increases with age, and there are assay methodologies for detecting macroprolactin. Because the measurement of macroprolactin does not alter the management of hyperprolactinemia in most older patients, it is not useful to measure macroprolactin routinely in the evaluation of hyperprolactinemia in older people.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 97-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>COMMON CAUSES OF HYPERPROLACTINEMIA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There are no known adverse effects of hyperprolactinemia per se in postmenopausal women.

Thus, measurement of prolactin is generally performed in older men with suspected hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and older men and women with a large pituitary mass (to determine if the tumor is a prolactinoma).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation and management <span class="p">The key factors for the evaluation and management of hyperprolactinemia in patients 65 years or older are the overall health and likely longevity of the patient, male sex, the presence or absence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and whether the hyperprolactinemia is mild, moderate, or severe.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients 65 years or older with mild hyperprolactinemia (20–50 ng/mL) will not generally benefit from therapy directed at lowering the serum prolactin. As noted above, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (causing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">testosterone deficiency and reduced fertility) is the single significant adverse sequela known to be directly related to hyperprolactinemia. Women and eugonadal men 65 years or older therefore will not benefit from resolution of mild hyperprolactinemia, but they should be assessed for primary hypothyroidism with a serum TSH. Serum prolactin measurement should be repeated when the patient has been sitting quietly for 15 minutes because mild hyperprolactinemia might be due to the stress of venipuncture. The patient’s medication list should be reviewed for prescription and over-the- counter medications associated with hyperprolactinemia, but it is not necessary to discontinue a medication that is suspected to be the cause of mild hyperprolactinemia (<span class="s1">Table 97-2</span>). Mild hyperprolactinemia rarely causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men. In men 65 years or older with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and mild hyperprolactinemia, another cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism should be considered, and the geriatrician should refer those men to an endocrinologist.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 97-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>MEDICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPERPROLACTINEMIA IN OLDER PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients 65 years or older with modest hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin 50–250 ng/mL) typically have a prolactinoma or more than one cause of hyperprolactinemia (eg, two medications that are associated with hyperprolactinemia). These patients should be referred to an endocrinologist who may evaluate other anterior pituitary function including the thyroid and gonadal axes and may order sellar imaging to ensure that the patient does not have a large pituitary tumor or other disease that affects prolactin secretion.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Virtually all patients 65 years or older with severe hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin &gt; 250 ng/mL) have a large prolactinoma. These patients should be referred to an endocrinologist to assess anterior pituitary function and sellar imaging. As with the evaluation of moderate hyperprolactinemia, the most important element of the evaluation of severe hyperprolactinemia is to determine if there is a large sellar mass or other pituitary pathology that requires treatment. It is not the hyperprolactinemia per se that requires management.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Optimal management of hyperprolactinemia necessitates collaboration between the geriatrician and an endocrinologist. The treatment of hyperprolactinemia depends upon whether the patient has hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and whether there is a large sellar mass that needs treatment with medication or surgery to reduce the size of the tumor. In general, women 65 years or older need treatment if there is a large sellar mass that is impinging on the optic tract or important intracranial structures. Men 65 years or older with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may be treated with androgen replacement therapy (or gonadotropin replacement therapy if fertility is desired), and testosterone replacement therapy is likely to be tolerated and more uniformly effective in normalizing serum testosterone than medical therapy with dopamine agonists (eg, cabergoline) to lower prolactin. Similar to women 65 or older, men 65 years or older with a large sellar mass should be evaluated to determine whether it benefits the patient to have medical or surgical therapy to reduce the size of the mass. In general, prolactinomas are treated with medical therapy (ie, dopamine agonists) if tumor shrinkage is deemed beneficial. Other pituitary masses and disease require therapies specific to the etiology of the mass.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pituitary Incidentaloma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physiology and presentation <span class="p">Pituitary tumors are commonly found during brain imaging with CT or MRI that is performed for a different indication than evaluation for pituitary disease.

Because patients 65 years or older may have brain imaging performed because of concerns about cognition dysfunction, head trauma due to falls or evaluations for possible strokes, geriatricians need to be aware of the following: most solid-appearing</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pituitary incidentalomas are nonsecretory benign pituitary adenomas, and most cystic incidentalomas are Rathke cleft cysts that represent benign remnants of embryological development of the pituitary.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation and management <span class="p">The geriatrician should generally refer patients with a pituitary incidentaloma to an endocrinologist. The minimum evaluation for a solid pituitary incidentaloma is a history and examination for evidence of a pituitary hormonal excess syndrome (eg, Cushing syndrome or acromegaly) and serum prolactin measurement. For a large (≥ 1 cm) pituitary macroincidentaloma (solid or cystic), a careful evaluation for pituitary hormone deficiency syndrome (eg, testosterone, LH and FSH; free T4 and TSH; and morning cortisol concentrations) should be done. The treatment of pituitary hormone deficiencies and pituitary hormonal excess syndromes is generally done by endocrinologists. Pituitary macroincidentalomas that are impinging on vital intracranial structures may need to be treated with medical therapy, radiation therapy, or surgery depending on the specific etiology of the mass. Pituitary macroincidentalomas are surveilled with serial sellar images (usually MRI) at 1- to 2-year intervals. There is some controversy about whether smaller tumors require surveillance and the most appropriate interval between imaging studies.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chronic Hypopituitarism</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physiology and presentation <span class="p">The anterior pituitary produces growth hormone, FSH, LH, TSH, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and prolactin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypopituitarism is defined by deficiency in two or more of the hormones. Prolactin deficiency is not clinically relevant in older adults, and growth hormone deficiency has minimal clinical relevance because most patients with chronic hypopituitarism do not have a significant benefit with growth hormone replacement therapy. The physiology of chronic hypopituitarism is characterized by which pituitary hormones are affected, and the presentation of untreated or undertreated hypopituitarism depends on which hormones are deficient. A characteristic of hypopituitarism is that the affected pituitary hormone(s) may be circulating at low, inappropriately normal, or even slightly elevated concentrations. In pituitary disease, the pituitary hormones that are detected by immunoassay are generally not fully bioactive due to the lack of normal post-translation modification.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology and causes <span class="p">Chronic hypopituitarism is very uncommon (incidence</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&lt; 0.5 per 100,000 annually), but the geriatrician may provide care for patients who have been already diagnosed with chronic hypopituitarism because these patients may live for many years after the diagnosis. In chronic hypopituitarism, there is end-organ atrophy and deficiency due to inadequate stimulation by affected anterior pituitary hormones. The most common causes of chronic hypopituitarism are a large (&gt; 1 cm) benign pituitary macroadenoma, cranial radiation, and severe head trauma. Chronic hypopituitarism usually occurs years after cranial radiation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Evaluation and management </span>The most common deficiencies of hypopituitarism are secondary hypogonadism and secondary hypothyroidism, but secondary hypoadrenalism, although less common, may be life-threatening. All patients with secondary hypoadrenalism should wear an alert bracelet or necklace. It is generally not beneficial to treat growth hormone deficiency in older people, and this expensive therapy should be initiated and monitored by an endocrinologist. Prolactin deficiency also does not require treatment in older people. The treatment of secondary hypogonadism is covered in the male hypogonadism section below and the menopause section in <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 36</span>.

ADH promotes water reabsorption from the kidney in response to increased plasma osmolality and also to large reductions in arterial volume and blood pressure. ADH and thirst are both regulated by hypothalamic osmoreceptors and by cardiovascular and intrathoracic baroreceptors, and are the main physiologic regulators of free water balance. ADH secretion and thirst preserve total body water and protect against dehydration and resultant hypernatremia as well as hypovolemia. ADH is regulated by small changes in serum osmolarity, and suppression of ADH secretion protects against hyponatremia due to excessive water intake. It is</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">important that geriatricians recognize age-related alterations in the homeostatic mechanisms that affect water balance.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Aging is associated with relative ADH excess with increased to normal basal (unstimulated) ADH concentrations and increased ADH response to osmotic stimuli, as well as decreased renal free water excretion are attributed mainly to an age-associated decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These physiologic changes with age predispose older persons to developing hyponatremia.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hyponatremia and Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hyponatremia or water excess is the most common electrolyte disorder experienced by older persons. In addition to a decrease in free water clearance due mostly to reduced GFR with age, aging is associated with a decrease in lean body mass and total body water (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 39</span>). Also, older people are more likely to have severe heart failure or liver disease that are each associated with appropriate increases of ADH secretion.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">More common than the latter, other age-associated comorbidities (such as brain and pulmonary disease, malignancy, and hypothyroidism) and use of medications that cause syndrome of inappropriate ADH ([SIADH] such as selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, and carbamazepine) are the main contributors to the increased prevalence of hyponatremia in older patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hyponatremia due to SIADH in older patients is usually mild with serum sodium concentrations as low as 130 mmol/L and asymptomatic. However, such hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, gait instability, falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, hospitalization, and nursing home placement. Management of hyponatremia is discussed in <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 39</span>.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk of Hypernatremia</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reduced thirst and fluid intake in response to fluid deprivation, hypovolemia, and hyperosmotic stimuli contribute to the increased risk of dehydration (water deficiency) and hypernatremia in older patients. Older patients with immobility or dementia who have limited access to or have reduced intake of water or other liquids are especially at risk for hypernatremia. ADH deficiency due to central diabetes insipidus (idiopathic or secondary to hypothalamic-pituitary disease) is a rare cause of hypernatremia and dehydration in older persons. Loss of the thirst response</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to dehydration that normally protects against hypernatremia makes diabetes insipidus difficult to manage in older patients who are treated with an ADH analog, desmopressin (diamino-<span class="s260">D</span>-arginine vasopressin, DDAVP). As such, older patients with diabetes insipidus should be referred to an endocrinologist for management. Management of hypernatremia is discussed in <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 39</span>.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nocturnal Polyuria</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Age-related blunting of nocturnal circadian ADH concentrations in addition to nighttime increases in atrial natriuretic hormone levels predispose older persons, particularly those with dementia including Alzheimer disease, to nocturnal polyuria. In contrast, patients with diabetes insipidus have daytime as well as nocturnal polyuria.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In older patients with age-related mobility impairment and bladder dysfunction, ADH dysregulation may contribute to urinary incontinence (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 47</span>). Older patients with nocturnal polyuria and incontinence may benefit from administration of desmopressin in addition to behavioral interventions and detrusor muscle relaxants, as causes of incontinence are often multifactorial. In older patients being treated with desmopressin, geriatricians should monitor serum sodium for the development of hyponatremia that might occur with excessive desmopressin dosage and/or excessive water intake while taking desmopressin.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ADRENAL</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The geriatrician will most commonly comanage three adrenal endocrinopathies: Cushing syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and adrenal incidentaloma.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cushing Syndrome</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cushing syndrome is a constellation of symptoms and signs of glucocorticoid excess and evidence of supraphysiologic exposure to glucocorticoids. Older patients are particularly susceptible to Cushing syndrome and its adverse effects because of decreased metabolism of glucocorticoids and a high prevalence of baseline frailty, sarcopenia, and osteopenia.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physiology and presentation <span class="p">Glucocorticoids are generally catabolic, and glucocorticoid excess results in muscle wasting and weakness, bone</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">resorption and osteoporosis, thin skin and easy bruisability, and body composition and metabolic changes. The average daily production of cortisol in a normal person is about 10 to 12 mg/m<span class="s22">2</span> body surface, and that is equivalent to about 15 to 20 mg daily of exogenous hydrocortisone.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Supraphysiologic replacement dosages suppress secretion of corticotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and result in reduced synthesis of ACTH in the anterior pituitary.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The most suggestive symptoms of Cushing syndrome are easy bruisability, broad (&gt; 1 cm) purple striae found typically on the abdomen and proximal muscle weakness and wasting. These symptoms are much less specific in older people who tend to have thin skin, particularly in areas that have had chronic sun exposure, and they also tend to have sarcopenia and weakness. In older people, thin skin and easy bruisability in body regions without extensive sun exposure may be a sign of glucocorticoid excess. Low- trauma fractures and osteoporosis with densitometry Z score of worse than</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">−2.0 (2 standard deviations worse than age-matched peers) may by an indication of Cushing syndrome.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology and causes <span class="p">The most common cause of Cushing syndrome is iatrogenic. There are no accurate estimates of the prevalence of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome, but prescription of supraphysiologic dosages of corticosteroids is very common, and the effect of these excessive dosages may cause adverse effects within weeks. Commonly prescribed oral formulations of hydrocortisone, prednisone, and dexamethasone do not reproduce the normal diurnal cyclicity of serum cortisol (with peaks in the early morning and a nadir at about midnight). Daily dosages of prednisone as low as 5 mg or dexamethasone of 0.75 mg are supraphysiologic for many older patients.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation and management <span class="p">Because Cushing syndrome may significantly impair the function of frail, older patients and significantly worsen the risk of major osteoporotic fractures, the geriatrician must be vigilant in collaborating with specialists who prescribe corticosteroids to discontinue corticosteroid therapy as quickly as feasible. In addition, the geriatrician has an essential role in collaborating with specialists and endocrinologists to use the lowest possible dosages of glucocorticoids if replacement or continual maintenance therapy is required. High dosages of inhaled or topical corticosteroids may also cause Cushing syndrome. Geriatricians who suspect Cushing syndrome</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should ask the patient about “natural remedies” and nonprescription medications because some of these health supplements contain adrenal extracts with glucocorticoids. If the geriatrician suspects endogenous Cushing syndrome, a rare and often difficult-to-diagnose disorder, then an endocrinologist should be consulted.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adrenal Insufficiency</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physiology and presentation <span class="p">Glucocorticoids are essential hormones for normal, healthy living. In addition to being “stress hormones” that are important for survival during severe illness or other physiologic stress, glucocorticoids are important for normal function of many organ systems such as the brain, gut, and the cardiovascular system. In severe glucocorticoid deficiency, patients may report fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, diffuse abdominal pain, weight loss, and dizziness, and they may have postural hypotension. Patients with long-standing primary adrenal insufficiency may have hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases, bite line of the buccal mucosa, gingivae, and nipples. These symptoms and signs may appear as a constellation or a patient may present with one or few of these as the predominant or sole presenting manifestation of adrenal insufficiency.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Compared to patients with secondary hypoadrenalism, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency due to adrenal disease are more likely to report dizziness and hypotension, and they are likely to have hyperkalemia because they have both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency. Patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic or pituitary disease (with loss of normal ACTH secretion) have glucocorticoid deficiency, but they typically do not have mineralocorticoid deficiency because aldosterone synthesis and secretion are primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin system that remains intact in secondary hypoadrenalism.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology and causes <span class="p">The incidence of adrenal insufficiency in patients 65 years or older is about 100 per 100,000, and the incidence might be higher in patients 85 years or older. As with Cushing syndrome, the most common cause of glucocorticoid deficiency (adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is iatrogenic due to prescription of chronic corticosteroids. The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in industrialized countries, autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison disease), rarely occurs in older patients.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primary adrenal insufficiency due to tuberculosis remains common worldwide, but it is very rare in older people who reside in industrialized</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">countries. On the other hand, primary hypoadrenalism secondary to bilateral adrenal hemorrhage may be more common in older adults who are more likely to be using one or more systemic anticoagulants than younger people.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation and management <span class="p">In general, the geriatrician’s role in the evaluation and management of adrenal insufficiency is to recognize that an older patient with weight loss, nausea, and nonspecific abdominal or back pain and weakness might have primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Secondary hypoadrenalism due to iatrogenic suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis by prolonged corticosteroid therapy is the most common and important cause of adrenal insufficiency in older patients: for example, abrupt discontinuation of chronic corticosteroid therapy for an inflammatory disorder such as polymyalgia rheumatica. The key questions for the geriatrician to ask when considering adrenal insufficiency in this setting are the following: (1) Has the patient been on topical, inhaled, oral, or injectable corticosteroids in the past year and then recently stopped them abruptly? (2) Has the patient been on systemic anticoagulants and had an episode of significant hypotension in the past year (suggesting the possibility of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage)?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The definitive diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is based on a stimulation test using corticotropin administered intramuscularly or intravenously. This test is usually done by an endocrinologist. In a properly executed corticotropin (Cosyntropin) stimulation test, the serum cortisol should exceed 18 mg/dL 30 to 60 minutes after the administration of corticotropin.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The management of chronic adrenal insufficiency is best done in collaboration with an endocrinologist, but the geriatrician should recall that oral hydrocortisone taken one to three times daily is generally the optimal glucocorticoid replacement therapy (<span class="s1">Table 97-3</span>). The usual replacement dosage of hydrocortisone is a total dosage of 15 to 20 mg daily; higher dosages may cause adverse effects of Cushing syndrome. The geriatrician should remind the patient of the importance of wearing an alert bracelet with clear language such as “Adrenal insufficiency. Give hydrocortisone 100 mg IM.” The geriatrician should also reinforce the “sick day” management of glucocorticoids that requires tripling the usual daily replacement glucocorticoid dosage (ie, 60 mg of hydrocortisone or the equivalent) for 3 days when the patient has a fever of 101.5°F or higher. The patient should take 100 mg of hydrocortisone intramuscularly if unable to take oral</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">glucocorticoid therapy due to illness. The patient should seek medical evaluation if not feeling significantly better after 3 days. Short-term administration of stress dosages of glucocorticoids generally should be given for all patients with adrenal insufficiency for severe systemic illness that requires care in an intensive care unit or for major surgeries. Consultation with an endocrinologist is useful to determine the dosage and duration.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 97-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>KEY POINTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY IN OLDER PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For patients with primary adrenal insufficiency due to destruction of all or part of both adrenal cortices, mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone is indicated if the patient has hyperkalemia or hypotension despite adequate glucocorticoid therapy. Patients with secondary hypoadrenalism do not need mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For patients that are on chronic corticosteroids (and likely have iatrogenic secondary hypoadrenalism), the geriatrician should educate the patient and family about the same principles of care including wearing an alert bracelet. The management of “sick days” is similar to above, but patients on chronic corticosteroids greater than 10 mg prednisone daily (or &gt; 1 mg dexamethasone) do not need to increase their dosage for “sick days.” When a decision is made to discontinue chronic (&gt; 1 month) corticosteroid therapy, a tapering of the dosage over days to months is necessary in order to allow the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to recover and to avoid adrenal crisis. The duration of the taper is related to the dosage and duration of chronic glucocorticoid therapy. Collaboration with an endocrinologist is often beneficial.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Adrenal Incidentaloma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Physiology and presentation <span class="p">By definition, adrenal incidentaloma presents as a radiologic finding on an imaging study ordered for an indication other than suspected adrenal pathology.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology and causes <span class="p">Adrenal masses are common and are found in about 4% of high-resolution CT abdominal scans.

Low radiodensity due to fat content on CT imaging (&lt; 10 Hounsfeld units) excludes malignancy and pheochromocytoma. Masses greater than 4 cm are more likely to be malignant.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Adrenal incidentalomas of higher density must be assessed for pheochromocytoma with a 24-hour urine collection for catecholamine metabolites or measurement of plasma-free metanephrines. Assessment for other hormone-secreting tumors is based on clinical suspicion by history and physical examination. For example, a patient with adrenal incidentaloma and spontaneous hypokalemia or hypertension should be evaluated for primary hyperaldosteronism. Finally, there is controversy about the value of assessment for mild or subclinical Cushing syndrome (also known as “autonomous cortisol secretion”) in adrenal incidentaloma. There is no consensus on follow-up imaging of adrenal incidentaloma, but most experts and guidelines recommend periodic follow-up until lack of significant growth (<i>≥ </i>5 mm in longest diameter in ≤ 12 months) makes malignancy very unlikely. Given the controversies, collaboration between the geriatrician and an endocrinologist is advised, as the geriatrician’s knowledge of the patient’s functional status, quality of life, and personal preferences are important to guide decision-making.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Endocrine Hypertension</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are multiple endocrinopathies that may raise blood pressure, but, for the geriatrician, the two most clinically important endocrine causes of hypertension are primary hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primary hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma present with blood pressure elevation as a primary manifestation, but the other endocrine causes of hypertension (eg, thyrotoxicosis, acromegaly or Cushing syndrome) tend to cause modest increases in blood pressure and have other findings that are much more prominent.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physiology and presentation <span class="p">Primary hyperaldosteronism causes hypertension by increased renal sodium reabsorption with passive water reabsorption, resulting in increased intravascular volume and blood pressure. Primary hyperaldosteronism also results in increased renal potassium excretion and is often associated with hypokalemia. Geriatricians should suspect primary hyperaldosteronism in older patients who have difficulty managing hypertension despite confirmation of adherence to a regimen for three or more antihypertensive medications or in patients with hypertension and spontaneous hypokalemia. Pheochromocytomas cause hypertension and tachycardia by the direct cardiovascular effects of catecholamines. In addition, catecholamines activate the renin-angiotensin pathway causing</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">hypertension via the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II and by sodium retention due to secondary hyperaldosteronism. A pheochromocytoma should be considered in patients with new onset of severe headaches or unexplained paroxysmal chest pain, diaphoresis, or tachycardia.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology of primary hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma <span class="p">Primary hyperaldosteronism occurs in 5% to 10% of patients with hypertension, but pheochromocytomas are very rare with an incidence of less than 5 per million per year. On the other hand, primary hyperaldosteronism is less likely to contribute to hypertension in older people, but pheochromocytoma appears to be more common after age 50.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation and management of primary hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma <span class="p">The initial evaluation of primary hyperaldosteronism is a plasma aldosterone to renin (plasma renin activity) ratio (ARR). Ideally, the blood sample is drawn in the morning after the patient has been out of bed for at least 2 hours. The patient should be instructed to be on a liberal sodium diet for a few days before testing. The only medication that must be stopped prior to the ARR assessment is spironolactone (for 4 weeks). Hypokalemia (that inhibits aldosterone and stimulates renin secretion) should be corrected before the test. Also, assessment of serum potassium on the same sample as the plasma aldosterone and renin is useful. The specificity of an elevated aldosterone to renin ratio is lower in older patients. The primary explanation for decreased specificity of this screening test is age-related decreases in basal and stimulated plasma-renin concentrations. In patients with primary hyperaldosteronism, the plasma aldosterone is generally greater than 10 ng/dL and the plasma-renin activity is undetectable or markedly suppressed (&lt; 1 ng/mL/hour). Because older patients are less likely to have a significant benefit with adrenalectomy than younger patients, the geriatrician may opt to commence aldosterone antagonist therapy (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone). In the occasional patient with a very high ARR, plasma aldosterone greater than 20, severe hypertension and spontaneous hypokalemia, consultation with an endocrinologist might be indicated for further evaluation for potential surgical excision of a unilateral adrenal aldosterone-secreting adenoma or asymmetric hypersecretion of aldosterone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Screening for pheochromocytoma is done by measurement of 24-hour urine catecholamines or plasma-free metanephrines when the patient is at baseline health and not under stress. There are a number of causes of false positives including psychological stress, acute illness, and certain</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">medications. A patient with a positive screening test for a pheochromocytoma should be referred to an endocrinologist. The treatment of pheochromocytoma includes localizing the source of excess catecholamine production and surgical extirpation.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TESTES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aging is associated with a gradual and progressive decline in serum total and free testosterone and increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG, the main binding protein for testosterone) concentrations. The decrease in testosterone concentrations is due both to an age-related decline in testosterone production by the testes (partially counterbalanced by a decrease in testosterone catabolism) and lack of an appropriate increase of pituitary gonadotropin production (to compensate for the lower blood testosterone concentration) due to altered hypothalamic gonadotropin- releasing hormone secretion.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypogonadism</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With the age-related decline in serum testosterone, an increasing proportion of older men have serum testosterone concentrations in the hypogonadal range, that is, below the normal range for young men. Aging is also associated with a parallel decline in sexual function, mood, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density that can all be manifestations of testosterone deficiency. However, the cause of these age-related changes is usually multifactorial, and these changes have numerous other etiologies that occur commonly in older persons.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Diagnosis </span>According to Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines, the diagnosis of hypogonadism in men of any age requires symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and a consistently low morning serum testosterone on at least two occasions, preferably fasting.

If possible, testosterone should be measured using a testosterone assay that is CDC- standardized for accuracy and reliability; testosterone assays used in most commercial reference laboratories are CDC certified. Also, because older age and age-associated comorbidities (eg, obesity) and use of certain medications (eg, anticonvulsants) may increase or decrease SHBG, guidelines recommend that an accurate free testosterone measurement, that is, calculated free testosterone or free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis, be measured to confirm a diagnosis of hypogonadism in older men.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations should be measured together with testosterone to determine whether the source of low testosterone is the testes (ie, primary hypogonadism indicated by low testosterone and high LH and FSH levels) or the hypothalamus or pituitary (ie, secondary hypogonadism indicated by low testosterone and low or inappropriately normal LH and FSH levels).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Prior to considering testosterone replacement therapy for hypogonadism, it is important to determine the etiology of hypogonadism and whether low testosterone is due to organic or functional hypogonadism.

Functional</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hypogonadism is caused by a nondestructive gonadotropin suppression that is potentially reversible with treatment of the underlying causative condition or discontinuation of the offending medication and may not require testosterone treatment (<span class="s1">Table 97-5</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:81.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 97-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>COMMON CAUSES OF FUNCTIONAL HYPOGONADISM IN OLDER MEN DUE TO POTENTIALLY REVERSIBLE SUPPRESSION OF GONADOTROPINS AND TESTOSTERONE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Once the diagnosis of hypogonadism is confirmed whether organic or functional and prior to or in conjunction with initiating testosterone treatment, geriatricians should consider alternative or adjunctive treatments of clinical manifestations of hypogonadism (eg, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor for ED; exercise and weight loss for low energy, depressed mood and muscle weakness; or bisphosphonates for osteoporosis). Also, treatment or management of potentially reversible functional causes of testosterone deficiency (eg, discontinuation of opioids) should be considered prior to or in addition to starting testosterone therapy. In many instances however, the cause of functional hypogonadism might not be treatable (eg, older patients taking opioids for chronic pain or morbidly obese older men who have failed attempts to lose weight and are not candidates for bariatric surgery). Older men with severe clinical and biochemical testosterone deficiency due to organic hypogonadism should be referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation and management.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Contraindications to testosterone treatment are active prostate cancer and breast cancer, as these malignancies might be stimulated by testosterone and its active metabolite, estradiol, respectively.

The Testosterone Trials (T Trials), a coordinated set of seven double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, provided evidence of short-term benefits and risks of testosterone treatment in 790 older men (average age 72) with unequivocal hypogonadism (symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and two morning total testosterone levels [by mass spectrometry] &lt; 275 ng/dL) for no apparent reason other than age. The T Trials evaluated the effect of testosterone versus placebo treatment for 1 year on sexual function, physical function, vitality, bone density, anemia, cognitive function, and coronary artery disease outcomes. Moreover, validated outcome measures were used, and testosterone dosages were adjusted to maintain serum concentrations between 500 and 800 ng/dL.

Short-acting intramuscular testosterone esters (testosterone cypionate and enanthate) and transdermal testosterone preparations are most often used to treat hypogonadism (<span class="s1">Table 97-7</span>). A short-acting testosterone ester (testosterone enanthate) administered subcutaneously using an autoinjector was approved recently; it has the advantage of not needing intramuscular injection but requires weekly injections which may be less desirable for some older men. Long-acting testosterone formulations (intramuscular testosterone undecanoate or testosterone pellets) cannot be withdrawn rapidly if an adverse effect develops and should be avoided in older men. Transbuccal, transnasal, and oral testosterone formulations that require administration two or three times daily are less practical for testosterone replacement therapy of older men, particularly those on multiple medications.</p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 97-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>MOST USED FORMULATIONS FOR TESTOSTERONE TREATMENT IN OLDER MEN</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Monitoring of both efficacy and safety should be performed during testosterone treatment.

PTH decreases urinary calcium and phosphate excretion by the kidney causing retention of calcium and phosphate in blood; stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption and release of calcium and phosphate into blood; and stimulates conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney and the latter stimulates absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 97-1. </span>Schematic representation of the hormonal regulation of calcium homeostasis by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D (D).

Initial laboratory evaluation of hypercalcemia should include a serum total calcium, albumin, and calculated corrected total calcium (total calcium corrected for serum albumin concentration) or ionized calcium. The corrected total calcium (preferred vs ionized calcium) = total calcium in mg/dL + 0.8 (4.0 − albumin in g/L) is usually elevated, but may be high-normal (known as normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism). Ionized calcium requires anaerobic serum collection and analysis within 1 hour of collection.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Therefore, ionized calcium is more susceptible to falsely abnormal values,</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for example, acidosis associated with delay in processing of samples, prolonged tourniquet use, or excessive muscle contraction with blood sampling will increase ionized calcium; and alkalosis associated with hyperventilation during blood sampling will decrease ionized calcium. Finally, 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine will exclude familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D will detect vitamin D deficiency that may accompany primary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 97-8 <span class="s3">■ </span>DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION FOR PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM IN OLDER PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It is useful to search laboratory records for previous serum calcium measurements because chronic hypercalcemia suggests primary hyperparathyroidism rather than malignancy. Corrected serum total calcium should be repeated to confirm hypercalcemia and serum intact PTH (using second- or third-generation immunoassay) should be measured to determine whether hypercalcemia is due to a PTH-dependent or PTH-independent cause (<span class="s1">Table 97-9</span>). If PTH-dependent hypercalcemia is established with high serum calcium and high or inappropriately high-normal serum PTH concentrations, the most likely diagnosis is primary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">However, further evaluation is needed to exclude other causes of PTH-</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dependent hypercalcemia and determine whether indications for surgical intervention are present.

However, cinacalcet has not been shown to decrease fracture risk and may cause gastrointestinal upset (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), dizziness, myalgias, and muscle weakness, and is poorly tolerated by older patients. Bisphosphonates may be used to improve bone mineral density (BMD), although there is no evidence of fracture prevention in these patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Active surveillance may be appropriate in older patients with contraindications to surgery. In these patients, monitoring should include serum calcium, creatinine, and eGFR yearly; three-site DXA BMD every 1 to 2 years; and abdominal imaging to detect an asymptomatic kidney stone.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vitamin D Deficiency</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Background and epidemiology <span class="p">There is not a consensus definition of vitamin D sufficiency and deficiency. Based on 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations that are optimal for bone health in the general population, the Institute of Medicine defined vitamin D sufficiency as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L); vitamin D insufficiency as a 25- hydroxyvitamin D of 12 to 20 ng/mL (30–50 nmol/L); and vitamin D deficiency as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D less than 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L). Based on the minimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations needed for fracture and fall prevention in frail, high-risk community-dwelling older patients, the American Geriatrics Society defined vitamin D sufficiency as a serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in community-dwelling older persons is 40% to 50%. Vitamin D deficiency is common in older, dark-skinned and obese persons, hospitalized patients and nursing home residents, and individuals taking medications that increase the metabolism of vitamin D (eg, phenytoin).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Physiology </span>The main source of vitamin D is synthesis of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in skin in response to UVB exposure in sunlight (see <span class="s1">Figure 97-1</span>). Dietary sources of vitamin D3 (animal sources) and D2 (ergocalciferol, plant sources) are limited, for example, fatty fish (eg,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">salmon, cod liver oil) and small amounts in fortified food. As a fat-soluble vitamin, vitamin D is stored in adipose tissue, and fat represents a large reservoir of vitamin D.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Vitamin D is metabolized in the liver where it is converted to 25- hydroxyvitamin D. The latter is further metabolized in the kidney to 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D, the biologically active form of vitamin D. Conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is increased by PTH and phosphate. Vitamin D deficiency that results in secondary hyperparathyroidism increases conversion of 25-hydroxy- to 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D. Therefore, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is a better biomarker of vitamin D deficiency than the biological active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D binds to vitamin D receptors in the intestines and enhances calcium and phosphate absorption. Vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D circulate bound largely to serum proteins, mainly vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The causes and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency may be categorized according to disorders of vitamin D production, metabolism, and action (<span class="s1">Table 97-11</span>). Older persons demonstrate numerous risk factors for vitamin D deficiency, including inadequate sunlight exposure (eg, individuals who are home-bound or live in a nursing home); heavy use of high-sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreen (advised for skin cancer prevention); decreased vitamin D substrate and synthesis in skin (independent of sunlight exposure); decreased 1-hydroxylation (conversion of 25-hydroxy-, to 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D) in the kidney (proportional to reduction in GFR); resistance to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D action in the intestines; and comorbidities and medications that affect vitamin D metabolism.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox"

manifestations <span class="p">Most patients with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D as low as 15–20 ng/mL or 38–50 nmol/L) are asymptomatic. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs in 40% and 50% of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 20 and 10 ng/mL (50 and 25 nmol/L) and increases the risks of BMD loss and low-trauma fractures.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with chronic severe vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 15 ng/mL) with secondary hyperparathyroidism may have cramps and tetany due to hypocalcemia; bone pain, pseudofractures, and fractures due to osteomalacia (impaired bone mineralization); worsening of osteoporosis and fracture risk; muscle aches and weakness; difficulty walking and functional impairment; and increased fall risk.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis <span class="p">Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency is confirmed by measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. However, 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays are highly variable and many are not standardized. If possible, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency should be confirmed using an assay that is standardized for accuracy and reliability, for example, by the CDC standardization program.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) have a diagnosis of or are at risk for osteoporosis or have sustained falls or are at risk for falls should undergo further evaluation. This evaluation should include serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, and alkaline phosphatase to detect secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased bone turnover; tissue transglutaminase to rule out celiac disease; and BMD by DXA, if not already performed, to assess fracture risk.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatme nt <span class="p">The treatment of vitamin D deficiency should include both adequate amounts of calcium intake in addition to vitamin D supplementation to prevent or treat secondary hyperparathyroidism. The combination of dairy intake and calcium supplementation (if needed) should total 1000 mg to 1200 mg daily. The calcium content of dairy foods can be estimated by the number of dairy equivalents (cup of milk = slice of cheese = cup of ice cream or yogurt = approximately 250 mg of calcium, accounting for intake of smaller amounts of calcium in other fortified foods and drinks).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition to calcium, patients with vitamin D deficiency should be treated with vitamin D2 or D3 (cholecalciferol). Older patients with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency should be treated with vitamin D2 or D3 800 to 1000 international units (IU) daily. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (serum 25 hydroxy-vitamin D concentration &lt; 15 or &lt; 20 ng/mL</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[&lt;38 or &lt;50 nmol/L] if patient is at high risk for fractures or falls) should be treated with higher dosages of vitamin D3, for example, 2000 IU daily for 6 to 12 months. Alternatively, severely vitamin D deficient patients may be treated with vitamin D2 50,000 IU weekly for 8 to 12 weeks, then vitamin D3 800 to1000 IU daily.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Individuals with gastrointestinal malabsorption require much higher calcium supplementation and dosages of vitamin D3 treatment. Patients with CKD stage 5 may require calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) treatment and should be referred to a nephrologist or endocrinologist.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The risk of vitamin D toxicity is rare using the dosages mentioned above and has not been reported to occur with prolonged use of vitamin D3 up to 4000 IU daily, the safe upper limit defined by the Institute of Medicine. The first indication of over-treatment with vitamin D is hypercalciuria which predisposes individuals to nephrolithiasis, and subsequently, hypercalcemia. Early biochemical indications of vitamin D toxicity have been reported to occur when 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels exceeded 90 ng/mL (225 nmol/L), but severe toxicity has not occurred until concentrations exceeded 150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PAGET DISEASE</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Background</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paget disease is a chronic local bone disorder characterized by osteoclast hyperactivity resulting initially in excessive bone resorption and subsequently disordered bone formation. The resulting disorganized bone architecture and enlargement contributes to bone fragility that is associated with an increased risk of fractures and bone deformities (eg, bowing of long bones with weight-bearing), as illustrated in <span class="s1">Figures 97-2 </span>and <span class="s1">97-3</span>. With time, bone turnover declines and bone becomes sclerotic. The etiology of Paget disease is unknown, but it is thought to occur in individuals with a genetic predisposition who subsequently develop a viral infection that causes the disease to become manifest in middle to late life.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">FIGURE 97-2. <span class="s5">Anteroposterior pelvis radiograph from a 72-year-old man with Paget disease of bone involving the entire pelvis. Femurs are not involved, but the right side of the pelvis has marked protrusion of the acetabulum.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epidemiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paget disease is most common in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand; it rarely occurs in Asia and Scandinavia. In the United States, the prevalence of Paget disease is 2% to 3% in persons 55 years or older and has been decreasing in the last two decades. The disease predominantly affects White people and slightly more men than women.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Presentation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paget disease most commonly affects the pelvis (~70%), lumbar spine and proximal femur (~50%), skull (~40%), and proximal tibia and humerus (~30%), that is, the axial skeleton. Most patients are asymptomatic. Paget disease is usually discovered incidentally on x-rays performed for other reasons or during an evaluation for an isolated high serum alkaline phosphatase. Constant aching bone pain (due to periosteal stretching and increased bone vascularity) or periarticular and joint pain (due to osteoarthritis secondary to periarticular bone enlargement and altered force transmission in affected joints) that is worse with weight-bearing and at night</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">develops in 40% of patients. Bone pain may affect ambulation, physical functioning, and fall risk in older patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Bones affected by Paget disease may become enlarged grossly and deformed (eg, bowed), and there may be increased warmth over affected bones due to increase blood flow associated with high bone turnover.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients may also develop osteoarthritis in an unaffected joint as a result of favoring the joint affected by Paget disease. Pain may also be due to fractures that can occur with minimal trauma. There is also a higher rate of nonunion, secondary skeletal deformities, and pseudo-fractures (transverse bands of demineralization).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Bone involvement and enlargement by Paget disease may be associated with neurologic complications. For example, skull involvement may cause hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus from cochlear damage, cranial nerve impingement and rarely, hydrocephalus; and vertebral Paget disease may cause spinal stenosis or ischemic steal syndrome that may rarely result in paraplegia or quadriplegia. Jaw involvement may cause loosening of teeth and ill-fitting dentures that may affect adequate nutritional intake in older persons.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In patients with a high burden of disease involving multiple bones (polyostotic Paget disease), high rates of bone turnover and release of calcium from bone may result in hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis with immobilization. Rarely, polyostotic Paget disease increases the risk of osteosarcoma, other primary and secondary bone malignancies, benign giant cell bone tumors, and high-output heart failure.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paget disease of bone is a radiographic diagnosis. Typically, plain radiographs (eg, <span class="s1">Figures 97-2 </span>and <span class="s1">97-3</span>) reveal a mixture of focal lytic areas (eg, flame-shape in long bones and punched out lesions in the skull) and sclerotic areas with coarse trabeculae, cortical thickening, and bone enlargement; sclerosis becomes predominant in late-stage disease with decline in bone turnover (“burnt out” Paget disease).</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 97-3. <span class="s5">Right proximal femur and pelvis radiograph of a 68-year-old man with Paget disease of bone involving both the femur and ileum.

Alkaline phosphatase may be normal or slightly elevated in monostotic Paget disease. In patients</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with normal alkaline phosphatase or liver disease, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (see <span class="s1">Table 97-12 </span>for other causes of elevation) or procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), another marker of osteoblast function, can be used to confirm the diagnosis and monitor disease activity. A radionuclide bone scan should be performed to assess the extent of bone involvement by Paget disease and asymptomatic sites. CT or MRI is not necessary unless there is suspicion for malignancy on plain radiographs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 97-12 <span class="s3">■ </span>CAUSES OF INCREASED SERUM BONE- SPECIFIC ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE IN OLDER PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Further evaluation of patients with Paget disease should include measurement of serum calcium to detect hypercalcemia that would require further evaluation and treatment and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to detect vitamin D deficiency that could contribute to elevated serum alkaline phosphatase.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment is not needed for asymptomatic patients with mild Paget disease who have minimal risk for complications. Indications for treatment include: symptoms of Paget disease or complications (eg, bone or joint pain, headache, neurologic complications, heart failure); prior to elective surgery at or adjacent to bone involved by Paget disease (eg, joint replacement, osteotomy for bone deformity, fracture fixation, resection of malignancy); active Paget disease in bone that has the potential of future complications (eg, risk of fracture in weight-bearing bone, hearing loss from skull involvement, paraplegia or quadriplegia from vertebral involvement with spinal stenosis); and hypercalcemia associated with immobilization.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The bisphosphonate zoledronic acid 5 mg IV over 15 to 20 minutes is the treatment of choice for Paget disease. It is more potent than other bisphosphonates and results in a longer duration of response.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bisphosphonates are contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min. These patients should be referred to an endocrinologist or metabolic bone specialist for management (usually with reduced dosages of zoledronic acid or denosumab). Zoledronic acid causes a rapid and sustained reduction in bone resorption and turnover; decreases alkaline phosphatase and bone scan activity; and improves bone pain and strength, physical function, and quality of life. In most patients, clinical remission following a single administration is sustained for 5 to 6 years and sometimes longer. Before administering zoledronic acid, patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation (as summarized earlier in this chapter) to avoid hypocalcemia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Zoledronic acid may induce a transient flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, bone pain, nausea). Acetaminophen treatment prior to and a few days after administration may reduce the likelihood of this adverse effect. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurs rarely with zoledronic acid treatment of Paget disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Acetaminophen, physical therapy, and other nonpharmacologic measures are often needed for joint and bone pain. In older patients, physical and occupational therapy are useful for gait training, fall prevention, shoe lifts, orthotics, cane, assistive devices for patients with gait disturbance, bone deformities, and spinal stenosis. Audiology evaluation for patients with hearing impairment and dental examination for those with jaw-bone involvement should be considered. In some patients with Paget disease, surgery might be necessary, for example, for bone deformities, prevention or treatment of fractures and spinal stenosis. If surgery is needed, immobilization should be avoided to reduce the risk of hypercalcemia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Preoperative zoledronic acid should be considered for orthopedic procedures on bones and joints affected by Paget disease.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many thanks to Christine Swanson, Kenneth Lyles, and Eric Orwoll for their contributions to the hyperparathyroidism and Paget disease components of this chapter in earlier editions of this book.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">American Geriatrics Society Workgroup on Vitamin D Supplementation for Older Adults.

Both excess and deficiency can have severe physiologic consequences. The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis ensures tight regulation of thyroid hormone concentrations, even in advanced age. In addition, the thyroid gland has evolved to have sufficient redundancy so that only a minority of the gland is required for normal thyroid function.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, the prevalence of all forms of thyroid disease, both functional and structural, increases in older people. An astute clinician is required, as recognition and management are more challenging in this age group.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHANGES IN THYROID FUNCTION WITH AGE</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thyroid Physiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;">The thyroid gland produces two thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T<span class="s11">4</span>) and triiodothyronine (T<span class="s11">3</span>), which differ only in the number of iodines (<span class="s1">Figure 98- 1</span>). T<span class="s11">4</span> is the major hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, at an amount that is 11 times the secretion of T<span class="s11">3</span>. Additional T<span class="s11">3</span> is produced peripherally by deiodination of T<span class="s11">4</span> in the liver, kidney, and brain. Within the cell, T<span class="s11">3</span> is the more potent hormone, binding to thyroid hormone receptors with higher</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">affinity. However, because T<span class="s11">4</span> levels act as a reservoir of thyroid hormone,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with a longer half-life and circulating concentrations 100 times higher than T<span class="s11">3</span>, T<span class="s11">4</span> concentrations are more commonly measured in the clinical setting.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition, both T<span class="s253">4 </span>and T<span class="s253">3 </span>are highly protein bound. Only 0.04% of T<span class="s253">4 </span>and 0.4% of T<span class="s11">3</span> circulate in the biologically active free state, with the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">remainder bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin, and albumin. A variety of conditions can affect levels of these binding proteins. Therefore, measurement of free T<span class="s11">4</span> is preferable to total T<span class="s11">4</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">when T<span class="s11">4</span> assessment is required.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Thyroid hormone levels are tightly regulated by TSH through a classic endocrine feedback loop (<span class="s1">Figure 98-2</span>). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) released from the hypothalamus stimulates pituitary production of TSH, which in turn stimulates thyroidal production of T<span class="s253">4 </span>and T<span class="s253">3</span>. T<span class="s253">4 </span>and T<span class="s253">3 </span>exert feedback control on the hypothalamus and pituitary to regulate TRH and TSH release. In essence, the pituitary and hypothalamus act as a thermostat to maintain thyroid hormone levels within a narrow range. Because of variation between individuals in thyroid hormone set point and the sensitivity of the pituitary to perturbations in the set point, TSH levels are used clinically to screen for thyroid problems, rather than levels of T<span class="s11">4</span> or T<span class="s11">3</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 98-2. </span>Feedback regulation for control of thyroid function that involves the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis.

The increase in TSH with normal aging</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">does not indicate occult thyroid failure, since free T<span class="s11">4</span> levels do not decline. Instead, there may be changes in the bioactivity of TSH or thyroidal sensitivity to TSH. Lower T<span class="s11">3</span> levels have been documented in healthy</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">centenarians compared to younger people and may reflect a decrease in deiodinase activity with aging.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Clearance of T<span class="s11">4</span> and T<span class="s11">3</span> decreases with age, leading to an increase in the half-life of T<span class="s11">4</span>. There is a compensatory decline in T<span class="s11">4</span> and T<span class="s11">3</span> secretion,</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">resulting in stability in thyroid hormone concentrations with age. Production of T<span class="s11">4</span> declines from 80 to 60 μg/day, and T<span class="s11">3</span> production declines from 30 to 20 μg/day. The half-life of T<span class="s11">4</span> increases from 7 days up to 9 days in those</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aged 80 and older. TBG concentrations do not change with age.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies increases in older people, particularly in women, consistent with an increase in autoimmune thyroid disease with age. Therefore, aside from a slight increase in TSH concentrations with age, deviations in thyroid function tests are not due to normal aging. Thus, when the TSH is abnormal in an older person, investigation of thyroid disease and exogenous processes that affect thyroid function should be pursued.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Impact of Drugs and Medical Conditions</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Iodine status, medications, and comorbid conditions can each affect thyroid function, either transiently or chronically (<span class="s1">Table 98-1</span>). All thyroid hormones contain iodine (see <span class="s1">Figure 98-1</span>). The optimal iodide intake is 150 μg/day, with no changes in this recommendation for older people. Thyroidal uptake of iodine is tightly regulated by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) to allow adaptations to variations in dietary supply and ensure that thyroid hormone synthesis does not fluctuate with changes in iodine status. Low iodide increases NIS, and high iodide decreases NIS. The effect of an iodine load on the thyroid gland depends on the underlying state of the gland, that is, whether it is normal or abnormal. When a normal thyroid is exposed to an iodine load, such as iodinated radiographic contrast, thyroid hormone synthesis is temporarily inhibited, followed by escape from this inhibitory effect and recovery, a phenomenon known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. These changes are usually clinically insignificant. In patients with underlying thyroid pathology, an iodine load can precipitate hypo- or hyperthyroidism.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s523" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 98-1 <span class="s524">■ </span>DRUGS THAT AFFECT THYROID FUNCTION</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 98-1. </span>Structures of T<span class="s387">4 </span>and the enzymatic pathways for deiodination of T<span class="s387">4 </span>to its major active metabolite, T<span class="s387">3</span>, and to reverse T<span class="s387">3 </span>in peripheral tissues.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic that can alter thyroid function in numerous ways. Some of these effects are mediated by the iodine content of amiodarone, which is 37% organic iodide by weight. In patients with a normal underlying thyroid, amiodarone administration may cause transient TSH elevation and chronically higher free T<span class="s11">4</span> and lower T<span class="s11">3</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">concentrations that do not require intervention. Occasionally, a destructive thyroiditis may occur and present as new-onset thyrotoxicosis, with increase in release of preformed thyroid hormone, as a result of a direct toxic effect of amiodarone. This can be treated acutely with corticosteroids. In patients with underlying thyroid nodular disease or Graves disease who receive amiodarone, increased thyroid hormone production may occur, which can be treated with methimazole. It can be difficult to distinguish among these etiologies of thyrotoxicosis at the time of presentation. Radioactive iodine scanning is not possible due to competition from the nonlabeled iodide in amiodarone, and so patients may initially be treated with both corticosteroids and methimazole. Patients with underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis may develop hypothyroidism, which is often reversible with cessation of amiodarone. In most cases, amiodarone should not be stopped when thyroid function abnormalities occur. The half-life of amiodarone is long, fat solubility is high, and the iodine load is large. It takes months for the effects</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of amiodarone to wear off, and thyroid dysfunction can generally be managed while continuing amiodarone treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Several oncology drugs can cause thyroid dysfunction. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy can each cause hypothyroidism that may be preceded by a destructive thyroiditis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypothyroidism also occurs with thalidomide use.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">High doses of corticosteroids and dopamine may each lower TSH levels without affecting thyroid function. This effect is important to remember when interpreting TSH testing in hospitalized patients who are administered either of these medications.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition, numerous medications and conditions affect production of thyroid-binding proteins. Estrogens, tamoxifen, and acute hepatitis increase TBG concentrations. This effect is compensated by increased thyroid hormone production in a normally functioning thyroid, to keep free thyroid hormones stable, but may result in changes in total T<span class="s11">4</span> concentrations.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conversely, androgens, chronic liver disease (through decreased synthesis of TBG), nephrotic syndrome, and severe systemic illness may decrease TBG concentrations. High-dose furosemide, heparin, and high doses of aspirin or salsalate decrease TBG binding to thyroid hormones without affecting TBG. When TBG concentration or binding is reduced, the thyroid produces less thyroid hormone to avoid elevation in free T<span class="s11">4</span> concentrations.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonthyroidal Illness Syndrome</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the setting of severe, nonthyroidal illness, alterations in thyroid function may occur, called the “nonthyroidal illness syndrome.” Alternative names are “low T<span class="s11">3</span> syndrome” and “euthyroid sick syndrome.” This altered pattern of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">thyroid function occurs in reaction to acute illness and may represent an adaptive slowing of metabolism as a physiologic response to systemic illness. It is likely that reduced caloric intake and cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of these changes in thyroid function. The first testing abnormality to manifest is low T<span class="s11">3</span> levels. These are a consequence of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">decrease in deiodination of T<span class="s11">4</span> to T<span class="s11">3</span>. In addition, there is a decrease in deiodination of reverse T<span class="s11">3</span> (see <span class="s1">Figure 98-1</span>), which has no activity at thyroid hormone receptors, to its metabolite, leading to increased</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">concentrations of reverse T<span class="s11">3</span>. Subsequent changes include a decrease in free</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">T<span class="s11">4</span> levels, followed by a mild decrease in TSH levels in those with the most</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">critical illnesses. Patients taking high-dose corticosteroids or dopamine may have completely suppressed TSH levels. The pattern of low TSH and low thyroid hormones is identical to that of central hypothyroidism. Central hypothyroidism is a rare cause of hypothyroidism and does not present without other manifestations of pituitary or hypothalamic disease. Additional diagnostic testing does not need to be pursued if the clinical picture supports nonthyroidal illness as the cause of thyroid testing abnormalities.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Measurement of reverse T<span class="s11">3</span> concentrations is not indicated. Patients with the full constellation of thyroid testing abnormalities have a high mortality rate, at 80%. Thyroid hormone replacement with T<span class="s11">4</span> or T<span class="s11">3</span> results in no benefit in</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the nonthyroidal illness syndrome. During recovery from nonthyroidal illness, TSH levels appropriately rise in order to stimulate thyroid hormone production, which may be interpreted as overt or subclinical hypothyroidism. In this setting, when the patient is also improving clinically, repeat thyroid function testing as an outpatient is preferred over initiation of levothyroxine.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">THYROID DYSFUNCTION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Classification</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When thyroid dysfunction is suspected clinically, the first step is to measure a TSH level. A low TSH is consistent with pituitary efforts to slow thyroid hormone production, as in hyperthyroidism, and a high TSH is consistent with pituitary efforts to stimulate thyroid hormone production, as in hypothyroidism (<span class="s1">Figure 98-3</span>). Further discrimination, based on measurement of free T<span class="s11">4</span> levels, can be made to distinguish between what have been termed</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">“subclinical” (normal free T<span class="s11">4</span>) and “overt” (abnormal free T<span class="s11">4</span>) dysfunction.

Of the 19 signs examined, the three signs found in more than 50% of older patients were tachycardia, fatigue, and weight loss. These data also show the paucity of classical symptoms of hyperthyroidism in older people, particularly hyperadrenergic symptoms, due to diminished physiologic response or concomitant β-blocker use, and increased prevalence of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nonclassical symptoms such as apathy and anorexia. This presentation has been referred to as “apathetic hyperthyroidism” and can be mistaken for a chronic wasting illness.

In thyroid storm, central nervous and cardiovascular systems may be particularly compromised, and patients may present with delirium, psychosis, coma, extreme tachycardia, or heart failure. Such patients usually require hospitalization and management by an endocrinologist. Although diagnostic criteria have been proposed for the diagnosis of thyroid storm, any patient whose clinical status is compromised from the effects of hyperthyroidism should be managed aggressively to remove the impact of thyroid dysfunction from the clinical picture.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Etiology and diagnosis </span>The term “hyperthyroidism” refers to overproduction of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland, whereas “thyrotoxicosis” is a broader term that encompasses any clinical situation with thyroid hormone excess, including thyroiditis or excess exogenous thyroid hormone. The majority of endogenous thyrotoxicosis is due to overproduction of thyroid hormone, either from autoimmune stimulation of the thyroid in Graves disease or an autonomous thyroid nodule within a nodular thyroid gland. These are usually permanent conditions. In younger people, Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, whereas with increasing age, multinodular toxic goiter increases in prevalence. Nodules within multinodular glands may become autonomous over time. Acute worsening of thyrotoxicosis can be precipitated by an iodine load in a patient with autonomous thyroid nodules, which are lacking a normal regulatory response to iodine. Less commonly, leakage of thyroid hormone due to autoimmune or viral thyroiditis can cause transient thyrotoxicosis that resolves within several weeks. The diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis does not require elevations in both free T<span class="s11">4</span> and T<span class="s11">3</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">concentrations. “T<span class="s11">3</span> toxicosis” may occur with normal free T<span class="s11">4</span> levels, particularly with autonomous nodules; conversely, only free T<span class="s11">4</span> levels may be elevated with concomitant nonthyroidal illness syndrome.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The process of assessment of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis does not</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">require invasive testing and does not differ between young and old adults. Although there are some clues from thyroid testing (T<span class="s11">4</span> and T<span class="s11">3</span> levels tend to be higher in Graves disease than in other etiologies) and physical</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">examination (the presence of proptosis, skin findings of pretibial myxedema,</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or thyroid bruit are specific for Graves disease), additional testing may be required. Measurement of thyroid receptor antibodies (TRAb) can be used to distinguish Graves disease from other causes. Radioiodine scanning is the definitive way to discriminate among thyrotoxicosis etiologies. NIS is highly expressed in the thyroid, with low levels in salivary glands, lactating breast, and placenta. It allows radioactive iodine scanning in a selective manner. It does not provide valid results in the setting of recent high unlabeled iodide intake, such as from iodinated contrast. Otherwise, it is a useful test to discriminate between high uptake (Graves disease and autonomous nodule) and low uptake (autoimmune or viral thyroiditis) states. Concomitant imaging may discriminate between diffuse uptake in Graves disease and focal uptake</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by an autonomous nodule. Thyroid ultrasonography may be useful when correlated with a radioiodine scan.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management <span class="p">The metabolic derangements of thyrotoxicosis can complicate the care of any coexisting condition in an older patient. Furthermore, there are multiple causes of thyrotoxicosis and multiple treatment options. Therefore, management should involve close collaboration between the geriatrics or primary care team and an endocrinologist. β-Blocking drugs are useful in the management of tachycardia and other hyperadrenergic symptoms from thyrotoxicosis of any etiology. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be useful for treating patients with subacute or silent thyroiditis. Patients who do not respond may require prednisone. Since the thyrotoxicosis is due to release of preformed thyroid hormone in these conditions, antithyroid drugs are not indicated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;"><b>Antithyroid drugs </b>are useful in the management of thyrotoxicosis due to overproduction of thyroid hormone from autonomous thyroid nodules and in Graves disease. The antithyroid drugs decrease thyroid hormone production by acting directly on the thyroid to interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis. Methimazole is the preferred drug due to a longer half-life and fewer adverse effects. Propylthiouracil (PTU) has the advantage of decreasing T<span class="s11">4</span> to T<span class="s11">3</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conversion, but its use has been limited by reports of fulminant hepatic failure. However, even in good candidates (Graves disease with mild to moderate hyperthyroidism and a small thyroid gland) recurrence exceeds 60%, and concerns about how well the older patient may tolerate a recurrence of hyperthyroidism should be considered prior to taking this approach. The most common side effects of either methimazole or PTU are skin reactions, which occur in 4% to 6% of patients. The most serious side effect is agranulocytosis, which occurs in 0.1% to 0.5% of patients. Rarely, methimazole can cause cholestasis, and both methimazole and PTU can cause antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitis or severe polyarthritis. Because of these risks, an endocrinologist should be involved in the selection and dosage of antithyroid drug therapy over time.</p><p class="s254" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Radioactive iodine <span class="p">is the preferred therapeutic option in patients who have persistent thyrotoxicosis due to overproduction of thyroid hormone. Radioiodine emits γ-rays and β-particles. It is used in low doses for diagnostic purposes and at higher doses for therapy. The effects are dose dependent, and the degree of uptake and size of the thyroid gland are considerations in determining the correct dose (as defined by nuclear</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">medicine). Any antithyroid drug should be stopped 3 to 5 days prior to treatment, though β-blocking drugs should be continued. Radioactive iodine induces necrosis of thyroid follicular cells followed by disappearance of colloid and fibrosis of the gland over months. Contact precautions must be observed for 5 days after treatment, and, if necessary, antithyroid drugs may be resumed 5 days after treatment. A plan for managing contact precautions must be devised before treatment for patients who are caregivers of young children or who have caretakers who are in close contact. Radioactive iodine that is not taken up by the thyroid is cleared in the urine, and patients with urinary incontinence must have a plan for disposal of contaminated absorptive pads. Older patients may benefit from pretreatment with methimazole to achieve euthyroidism more quickly and “cool” down before radioactive iodine or surgery.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Autonomous nodules can be treated definitively with radioactive iodine.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the autonomous nodule is the source of thyrotoxicosis, the remaining normal gland will be unaffected by radioactive iodine therapy, resulting in normal thyroid function after ablation of the affected thyroid nodule.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radioactive iodine therapy is commonly used in the long-term management of thyrotoxicosis due to Graves disease. The goal of radioactive iodine therapy in Graves disease is ablation of all functioning thyroid tissue, with resultant hypothyroidism. Incomplete ablation increases the risk of recurrence due to regrowth of thyroid tissue secondary to persistent stimulation by antibody binding to the TSH receptor. The advantage of radioactive iodine ablation is the permanency of treatment without the risks associated with thyroidectomy, though contact precautions must be observed for 5 days after treatment, ophthalmopathy may be exacerbated, and thyroid function monitoring is required every 4 to 6 weeks after treatment until the patient is taking a stable dose of thyroid hormone replacement.</p><p class="s254" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Thyroidectomy <span class="p">is the fastest way to achieve euthyroidism, but because of increased operative risk in older patients, it is reserved for select cases, such as concomitant thyroid cancer or severe ophthalmopathy. Only an experienced thyroid surgeon should perform the thyroidectomy. Potential complications include transient or permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and hypoparathyroidism.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Subclinical Hyperthyroidism</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as low TSH with normal levels of free T<span class="s11">4</span> and T<span class="s11">3</span>.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism in older people increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and overall cardiovascular mortality. It is also associated with increased risk of fracture and dementia. Current recommendations support treatment of older people with subclinical hyperthyroidism to achieve euthyroidism by laboratory testing. The therapeutic options are the same as those for overt hyperthyroidism.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypothyroidism</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a high TSH with low free T<span class="s11">4</span> concentrations.

Symptoms of hypothyroidism are often, but not always, opposite to those of hyperthyroidism, and manifest as a generalized slowing of metabolic processes (<span class="s1">Table 98-4</span>). Cognitive changes and functional decline are late manifestations of unrecognized hypothyroidism. As with younger individuals, cardiovascular, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal symptoms predominate. Unfortunately, there is no single defining symptom that is specific to hypothyroidism. One or more of the myriad symptoms should prompt evaluation by TSH testing. <span class="s1">Table 98-5 </span>displays symptoms of hypothyroidism and their frequency in a study of 121 overtly hypothyroid young and old patients. Of the 24 signs examined, fatigue and weakness were the two signs found in more than 50% of older patients. The usual clinical signs were not well represented in older people. Since the effects of hypothyroidism are reversible with treatment, clinicians caring for older patients should measure TSH at the earliest indication of hypothyroid symptoms.</p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 98-4 <span class="s3">■ </span>CLINICAL FEATURES OF HYPOTHYROIDISM IN OLDER PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:49.5pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 98-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>COMPARISON OF CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERT HYPOTHYROIDISM IN OLDER VERSUS YOUNG</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s525" style=" background-color: #762184;">PATIENTS                           </span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Etiology and diagnosis </span>The etiologies of hypothyroidism are similar in older and younger adults. Primary hypothyroidism from thyroid failure is the most common source of thyroid dysfunction; central hypothyroidism from pituitary or hypothalamic failure is rare. Primary hypothyroidism is largely due to autoimmune destruction of the thyroid (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis; Hashimoto thyroiditis), though exogenous destruction of the thyroid from surgery or radiation (including radioactive iodine therapy) and drugs are also common (<span class="s1">Table 98-6</span>). All compounds containing iodine, including amiodarone and lithium, as well as interferon-α, interleukin 2 (IL-2), tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib, and checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab, may accelerate hypothyroidism in a gland with underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis (see <span class="s1">Table 98-1</span>). Transient hypothyroidism can also</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">occur during recovery from thyroiditis or acute, nonthyroidal illness. Bexarotene and octreotide can cause secondary hypothyroidism. A serum TSH is the initial diagnostic test for detection of hypothyroidism; both TSH and free T<span class="s11">4</span> should be measured if central hypothyroidism is a clinical</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">consideration.

Levothyroxine therapy should be used, and therapy is usually lifelong. Tissue deiodination of ingested levothyroxine to T<span class="s11">3</span> allows</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">physiologic thyroid hormone replacement without the need for additional T<span class="s11">3</span> replacement. T<span class="s11">3</span> or dessicated thyroid hormones should not be used for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">thyroid hormone replacement in older people due to risk of adverse cardiac effects from supraphysiologic T<span class="s11">3</span> concentrations. Levothyroxine is available in 12 to 25 μg increments to allow precise titration. Side effects are largely</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">from inappropriate dosing.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Considerations for initial dosing include the age of the patient and degree of thyroid failure. In patients aged 65 or older who have cardiac disease, it is usually recommended to “start low, go slow.” It should be noted that the benefit of this approach, compared with starting with a full estimated starting dose, has not been tested in a clinical trial. The smallest available doses, 25- and 50-μg tablets, are reasonable starting doses in older people. TSH testing usually occurs 6 weeks (six half-lives of levothyroxine) after initiation of treatment, but older people may benefit from 7 to 8 weeks to achieve steady state, given lower clearance of thyroid hormone. Dose increments initially may be as high as 25 μg, but finer titrations in 12 μg increments are preferred once the dose is above 75 to 100 μg. The target TSH is toward the upper limit of the normal range and could be as high as 4 to 6 mU/L in those older than age 80. While there is individual variation, full replacement of thyroid hormone is often required, regardless of the severity of hypothyroidism initially. The usual full replacement dose in older adults is lower than the 1.6 μg/kg/day recommended in younger patients. Care should be taken to avoid overreplacement, which may have adverse effects. If given intravenously, 75% of the oral dose should be administered.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The pace of progression of thyroid failure is variable, though once TSH levels stabilize, TSH testing need only be performed on an annual basis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When variability in TSH levels occurs, difficulty with adherence should be considered first. For example, a patient taking 112 μg of levothyroxine daily who misses one dose per week will have an average daily dose of 96 μg, which could be sufficient to cause TSH elevation. If an increase in TSH occurs after concentrations have stabilized, drugs or conditions that decrease levothyroxine absorption, increase levothyroxine metabolism, or increase TBG should be considered (<span class="s1">Table 98-7</span>). These situations may require an increase in levothyroxine dose. After exclusion of these drugs and conditions, it is reasonable to consider progression of endogenous thyroid disease if TSH increases. If a decrease in TSH occurs after concentrations have stabilized, factors that decrease TBG levels should be considered (<span class="s1">Table 98-7</span>).</p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 98-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>DRUGS/CONDITIONS AFFECTING LEVOTHYROXINE DOSAGE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Thyroid hormone replacement has a narrow therapeutic window, and iatrogenic hyperthyroidism should be avoided. As many as 40% of older</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">individuals taking thyroid hormone replacement may have a low TSH. Potential risks from iatrogenic hyperthyroidism parallel those of endogenous hyperthyroidism, most notably atrial fibrillation and bone loss. Careful initial titration and subsequent monitoring should reduce the risk of overreplacement.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Myxedema coma <span class="p">Myxedema coma is a serious medical condition that occurs almost exclusively in older people. Despite the name, the patient does not have to be in coma, though an altered mental status is common. The usual presentation is long-standing untreated hypothyroidism, with decompensation often precipitated by infection, cold exposure, alcoholism, or use of narcotics, sedatives, or antipsychotic medication. It is characterized by profound slowing across systems, including hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. A thermometer capable of reading low temperatures may be required. Close monitoring is required, and headaches, erratic behavior, and neurologic symptoms such as ataxia, nystagmus, and muscle spasms may be harbingers of impending coma. Hyponatremia and hypoglycemia as well as elevated creatinine phosphokinase of muscle origin may also be present.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Treatment of precipitating factors and supportive therapy for any associated metabolic disturbances is as important as initiation of thyroid hormone replacement. Serum should be obtained for cortisol measurement, and then intravenous hydrocortisone should be initiated to treat impaired adrenal reserve that may be present in profound hypothyroidism. Treatment with thyroid hormone without hydrocortisone can precipitate adrenal crisis. Hydrocortisone may be stopped if the cortisol level is found to be adequate. An initial dose of 200 to 400 μg of levothyroxine should be initiated, followed by 75 to 100 μg daily. The addition of a T<span class="s11">3</span> preparation, which has</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">more immediate effects than levothyroxine, has the risk of acute cardiac effects, and is generally discouraged in an older patient. Metabolism of all medications is diminished in profound hypothyroidism, and sedatives should be especially avoided.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Subclinical hypothyroidism </span>Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a high TSH with a normal level of free T<span class="s11">4</span>. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is 4% in the general population. The prevalence increases with age, to</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">approximately 10% of those aged 65 or higher, and it is more common in</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">women. Follow-up testing and indications for treatment are based on the degree of TSH elevation and patient age, as summarized in <span class="s1">Figure 98-4</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TSH elevations may be transient, due to recovery from silent thyroiditis or from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome. Therefore, repeat testing is recommended in 1 to 3 months if the initial TSH is 4.5 to 14.9 mIU/mL and in 1 to 2 weeks if the initial TSH is 15.0 mIU/mL or higher. The etiologies of subclinical hypothyroidism are the same as overt hypothyroidism, though many older patients without any risk factors for hypothyroidism or</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">antithyroid antibodies are found to have subclinical hypothyroidism. Studies in overt hypothyroidism underscore the difficulty with using symptoms to define the severity of thyroid dysfunction in an older person. The milder physiologic abnormalities of subclinical hypothyroidism result in an even greater diagnostic challenge, particularly given the frequency of hypothyroidism-like symptoms in older people without thyroid disease.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 98-4. </span>General therapeutic approach to the management of subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults. <span class="s17">a</span>Recommendation is based on an association of subclinical hypothyroidism with increased rates of the outcomes listed and is not based on clinical trial</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">evidence that treatment can reduce these outcomes.

There is a dose-response relationship between the degree of TSH elevation and incident risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure in people with untreated subclinical hypothyroidism. Independently of age, a TSH concentration of 10 mIU/L or higher predicts increased cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. A TSH concentration of 7 mIU/L or higher predicts cardiovascular mortality. However, subclinical hypothyroidism is not associated with fractures, dementia, or depression.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although skeletal muscle function is impaired in hypothyroidism, one study found older individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism to have better physical function than their euthyroid counterparts, and another showed decreased mortality in older individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism did not improve fatigue or hypothyroid symptoms in a randomized trial of individuals aged 60 or older. However, no randomized trials with clinical endpoints have been performed.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Per <span class="s1">Figure 98-4</span>, levothyroxine therapy at 25 to 50 μg daily should be initiated for patients aged 65 and older if the TSH is persistently 10.0 mU/mL or higher, and treatment should be considered if the TSH is 7.0 to 9.9 mU/mL. The average replacement dose in subclinical hypothyroidism is 1 μg/kg/day, which is lower than that of overt hypothyroidism, though the treatment goals are the same. The risks of iatrogenic subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism should be avoided when initiating levothyroxine therapy in this age group. There are no adverse consequences to following older patients who have TSH levels less than 7 mIU/L with annual testing. As the rate of progression to overt hypothyroidism is low in this range, no treatment is recommended.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Screening</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because the adverse effects of overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are reversible with treatment, the symptoms are often less pronounced or atypical in older people, and TSH is a readily available test, screening older people for thyroid dysfunction has been proposed. However, the management</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of subclinical thyroid dysfunction, which is more common than overt disease, is not sufficiently supported by clinical trial data. Furthermore, the definition of the reference range may differ between older and younger people. If the 95% confidence interval is applied to a population free of thyroid disease, the upper limit of the reference range is 3.6 mIU/L for 20 to 29 year olds, but</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7.5 mIU/L for those aged 80 and older. The US Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for thyroid dysfunction. This recommendation is unlikely to change until there is clear evidence to support management of any TSH concentration found on screening.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">NODULAR THYROID DISEASE AND THYROID CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thyroid Anatomy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thyroidal size is similar in older and younger individuals, and the volume of the thyroid correlates more with body weight than with age. Pathologic evaluation shows increased frequency of lymphocyte infiltration, fibrosis, and diminished colloid and follicle size in older people. Palpation of the thyroid gland may be more difficult in older individuals in the setting of pulmonary disease or kyphosis. With increasing age, there is an increase in the frequency of both thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. The higher incidence with age is not entirely due to detection bias from increased frequency of radiologic testing, such as computed tomography (CT) scans or carotid ultrasounds, though the initial presentation of a thyroid nodule in an older person is often an incidental finding.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation of Thyroid Nodules</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In autopsy series, 50% of thyroid glands have one or more thyroid nodules. Multinodular glands are more common in people from areas of iodine insufficiency. Patients with a history of childhood radiation to the neck or childhood exposure to ionizing radiation have an increased risk of developing thyroid nodules. The majority of these nodules are benign, though these nodules have an increased risk of thyroid cancer, which declines starting four decades after initial exposure.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The evaluation of a thyroid nodule does not differ by age. The main consideration is detecting the malignancy present in 7% to 9% of thyroid</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nodules. Men have a higher risk of malignancy than women. Nonpalpable nodules discovered incidentally have the same risk of malignancy as palpable nodules of the same size. Patients with multiple nodules have the same risk of malignancy as patients with a solitary nodule. Any palpable thyroid abnormality or one found through an imaging modality should be examined via a dedicated thyroid ultrasound. In addition to size in three dimensions, high-risk nodule characteristics such as hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, taller-than-wide shape, intranodular vascularity, and microcalcifications, as well as low-risk characteristics, such as spongiform appearance or noncalcified, mixed cystic and solid composition, should be documented. The presence and characteristics of lymph nodes should be assessed. A TSH should also be measured. Patients who have a low TSH should undergo a radionuclide thyroid scan to assess for thyroid nodule functioning; functioning “hot” nodules rarely harbor malignancy and do not require cytologic evaluation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">All other patients meeting the criteria in <span class="s1">Table 98-8 </span>should undergo fine- needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasound guidance, which improves the accuracy. For multinodular goiters, any nodule that meets criteria for aspiration should undergo FNA. Categories of FNA results are summarized in <span class="s1">Figure 98-5</span>. Nodules with either atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesions of undetermined significance should have additional analysis of aspirates using molecular analysis, using either an mRNA classifier system or mutational analysis. Nodules determined to be benign should have ultrasound follow-up, and those at high risk of malignancy should be removed surgically, usually a total thyroidectomy.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 98-8 <span class="s3">■ </span>FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION (FNA) OF A THYROID NODULE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 98-5. <span class="s5">Algorithm for management of patients presenting with nodular thyroid disease, based on results of fine-needle aspiration (FNA).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Benign Nodular Disease</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nodules that did not meet initial criteria for FNA or underwent FNA with benign pathology have a low likelihood of a later diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Current understanding of thyroid cancer biology suggests that a cancerous nodule develops as a cancerous nodule, and that benign nodules do not become cancerous over time. However, because false negatives do occur, periodic ultrasound surveillance is advised for nodules that did not meet initial criteria for FNA, either due to size or sonographic characteristics, or whose FNA results indicated a benign diagnosis. On</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">follow-up ultrasounds, each nodule should be evaluated for the development of size or ultrasound characteristics that meet criteria for FNA. Benign nodules should be followed up with a repeat thyroid ultrasound in 12 to 18 months, and continued ultrasound surveillance every 2 to 5 years, with FNA for development of sonographically suspicious features or significant growth. Any nodule that has undergone FNA twice does not need additional aspirations, due to the vanishingly small likelihood of two false-negative FNAs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Nodular goiters may grow to the point of causing compressive symptoms, including dyspnea or wheezing from tracheal narrowing or disturbances of swallowing from esophageal impingement. These goiters often have a substernal component which can be evaluated by CT scan of the neck. Flow- volume loop evaluation through pulmonary function testing can be used to evaluate extrinsic compression in the neck, and barium swallow evaluation can demonstrate the degree of thyroidal extension abutting the esophagus.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even if FNA confirms benign nodular disease, thyroid surgery may be indicated to relieve mass effect from an enlarged nodular goiter.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thyroid Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The incidence of thyroid cancer increases with age, peaking at age 65 to 69 at 29.6 per 100,000. Thyroid cancer can be of follicular cell origin (papillary, follicular, or anaplastic) or C-cell origin (medullary thyroid cancer). Thyroid lymphoma and metastases to the thyroid can also occur. The majority of thyroid cancers are papillary thyroid carcinomas. Older patients are more likely to present with more aggressive disease, higher recurrence rates, and multicentricity. However, the prognosis of thyroid cancer is excellent and improving, with 5-year survival rates of 98% in those aged 50 to 64, 97% in those aged 65 to 74, and 88% in those aged 75 or older.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis of thyroid cancer is made via cytologic interpretation of FNA specimens. Surgery is the primary modality for management of thyroid cancer, irrespective of age. For patients with tumors of 1 to 4 cm without extrathyroidal extension and no lymph node involvement, lobectomy may be performed instead of total thyroidectomy. This surgery should be performed by an experienced thyroid surgeon, with lymph node sampling as indicated. For thyroid cancer confined to the thyroid gland, no additional initial therapy is required. Thyroid hormone replacement is required after total thyroidectomy. Since TSH has a trophic effect on the thyroid, a high</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">levothyroxine dose is recommended in high-risk patients to suppress TSH levels. In low-risk patients, maintaining a TSH in the lower half of the normal range is acceptable. Cardiac effects of high levothyroxine doses can be mitigated by β-blockers and bisphosphonates attenuate effects on bone.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A subset of patients requires additional therapy, such as radioactive iodine ablation of residual disease in the neck or metastatic outside the neck, capitalizing on the retention of NIS in the majority of differentiated cancers of follicular origin. Radioactive iodine scanning for residual disease can be performed with recombinant TSH treatment, avoiding the physiologic consequences associated with withdrawal-induced hypothyroidism.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multitargeted kinase inhibitors are available for patients with metastatic disease that does not respond to radioactive iodine therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;"><b>Medullary thyroid carcinoma </b>should be treated with total thyroidectomy, and residual disease can be monitored through assessment of calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Since the C-cells do not contain NIS, radioactive iodine therapy has no effect on medullary thyroid carcinoma. For extensive nodal disease or local disease in the neck, external beam therapy can be considered. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been used in progressive systemic disease. All patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma should undergo genetic testing for a <i>RET </i>germline mutation.</p><p class="s254" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma <span class="p">is an undifferentiated thyroid cancer that is typically found in older people, with a mean age at diagnosis of 65. It has the worst prognosis of any thyroid cancer, due to rapid growth and local invasiveness, and the treatment team should include palliative care expertise. Patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma often have a multinodular goiter or history of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The presentation of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is as a rapidly enlarging neck mass. Thyroidectomy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have limited benefit, and median survival from diagnosis is 5 months.</span></p><p class="s254" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Thyroid lymphoma <span class="p">is also rapid growing, and usually arises in a background of Hashimoto thyroiditis. Like anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, it presents as a rapidly growing mass that may cause compressive symptoms, but the response to treatment is better. A characteristic asymmetrical pseudocystic pattern is present on ultrasound. Large needle or surgical biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis. Treatment with radiation and chemotherapy and prognosis parallel other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and thyroidectomy is not indicated.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Drs.

Although it is recognized by its effects on carbohydrate metabolism to cause hyperglycemia, diabetes usually also affects lipid and protein metabolism.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With time, effects of diabetes on the cardiovascular system, the kidneys, the retina, and the peripheral nervous system, often referred to as long-term complications of diabetes, substantially increase mortality and morbidity in older adults. Furthermore, diabetes may accelerate the risk and contribute to worse outcomes for other common age-related conditions, including physical function decline, cognitive impairment, and geriatric syndromes. Older adults with diabetes are highly heterogeneous in their health and functional status.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many older adults who are relatively healthy and have good functional status may benefit from the same aggressive, often complex diabetes care regimen that is recommended for younger adult diabetes patients. However, the risks and difficulties of implementing such a diabetes care regimen may lead to more harm than benefit for some older adults, especially those who have many comorbidities. Therefore, diabetes management and goals of care for older adults should be individualized to address the heterogeneity of this population. More research is needed to identify optimal care for older patients with diabetes, improve their functional outcomes, and preserve their long-term independence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DEFINITION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous set of disorders affecting multiple body systems; however, diabetes diagnostic criteria are based on documentation of elevated blood glucose levels.

While evidence of cell-mediated autoimmunity is a hallmark of type 1 diabetes, some patients develop a type 1 diabetes phenotype with evidence of severe insulin deficiency and episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with no detectable autoimmunity. Such individuals have idiopathic type 1 diabetes.

Hyperglycemia, often asymptomatic, is the hallmark and DKA is not part of the clinical syndrome. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a progressive insulin secretory defect, but severe absolute insulin deficiency is usually not present. Coexisting obesity is common, and resistance to insulin’s metabolic effects is usually a characteristic feature. While there is a strong genetic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">predisposition to development of type 2 diabetes, its etiology remains unknown and is likely to be both highly heterogeneous and multifactorial. The interaction between genetics, lifestyle factors, and aging in the development of type 2 diabetes is discussed later in this chapter in the section on “Pathophysiology.”</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Specific Types of Diabetes</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ADA classification for diabetes mellitus identifies a number of specific conditions that lead to development of diabetes, each of which is relatively uncommon. One group of disorders includes genetic defects of the pancreatic β-cell. The clinical phenotype for these genetic disorders is maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY). These genetic disorders have autosomal dominant inheritance with first presentation of asymptomatic hyperglycemia early in life. Patients with MODY can live to old age, however, and therefore become part of the spectrum of diabetes in an older adult population. The metabolic disorder in some affected individuals may be mild, whereas others may develop symptomatic hyperglycemia and long-term complications of diabetes mellitus similar to patients with typical type 2 diabetes. Another type of genetic defect has been identified in a few families in which insulin processing prior to secretion is impaired, which can predispose to development of hyperglycemia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Other families have genetic defects affecting insulin action. Severe insulin resistance results, and when it is not adequately compensated for by increased insulin secretion, hyperglycemia occurs. Diseases of the exocrine pancreas can lead to damage to pancreatic β-cells, diminished insulin secretion, and hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia also can occur in patients with excessive secretion of hormones that adversely affect carbohydrate metabolism, such as in acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, glucagonoma, and pheochromocytoma. Similarly, tumors making aldosterone can cause hyperglycemia as a result of hypokalemia-induced inhibition of insulin secretion. A number of drugs or toxins can impair insulin secretion or insulin action and lead to the development of hyperglycemia. <span class="s1">Table 99-2 </span>lists such drugs. Several genetic neuromuscular disorders are associated with diabetes mellitus, but they are rare in the older adult population.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>DRUGS THAT MAY INCREASE GLUCOSE LEVELS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) refers to the first identification of an alteration in glucose metabolism during pregnancy. While GDM per se is not part of the spectrum of diabetes in older adults, a history of GDM may be part of the background of an older woman presenting with type 2 diabetes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GDM has been aggressively screened for and treated, thus increasing numbers of women reaching the geriatric age group will have this history, as GDM affects approximately 4% of all pregnancies in the United States. After pregnancy, 5% to 10% of women with GDM continue to have type 2 diabetes. Women who have had GDM have a 20% to 50% chance of developing diabetes in the next 5 to 10 years.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic Criteria</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rationale for the circulating glucose level criteria shown in <span class="s1">Table 99-1 </span>is based on prediction of risk for diabetes-related complications. For example, a 2-hour value during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL is a strong predictor of diabetes complications, even when the fasting glucose level (FPG) is less than 126 mg/dL. The term “isolated postchallenge hyperglycemia” (IPH) is sometimes used for individuals who meet the 2-hour OGTT criterion for diabetes, but who do not meet the fasting glucose criterion. There is no age adjustment in the recommended criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus because the same glucose level cut points that predict complications appear to apply regardless of age.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Since 2010, diagnostic criteria for diabetes include a hemoglobin A1C level of 6.5% or higher. An A1C of 6.5% or higher predicts diabetic retinopathy at approximately the same rate (ie, 10%) as in individuals who are diagnosed on the basis of the fasting and postchallenge glucose criteria.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Adding A1C as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes can improve the identification of asymptomatic diabetic patients. About 20% of people who meet criteria for diabetes, or 8 million of the US population, are undiagnosed. The A1C test does not require the patient to be fasting; it can be done at any time that a clinical visit is scheduled, is simpler to perform than the OGTT, and is less dependent on the patient’s health status at the time a blood sample is obtained. On the other hand, the A1C level will be falsely lowered by any health condition that shortens red blood cell survival such as acute or chronic blood loss, hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, spherocytosis, and severe hepatic and renal disease. Among certain ethnic populations such as African-Americans, the A1C level is slightly higher than in White Americans when matched for actual degree of glycemia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The three different criteria shown in <span class="s1">Table 99-1 </span>are not entirely concordant in diagnosing diabetes. For example, in a sample of adults aged 70 to 79 years without known diabetes, 36% of them met the criteria for diabetes using both A1C and FPG test; another 36% met the criteria using A1C only and 28% using FPG only. When comparing FPG, OGTT, and A1C tests to diagnose diabetes, A1C identified the fewest individuals as having diabetes. Such studies suggest that A1C, FPG, and OGTT measure different aspects of glycemia. Furthermore, the discordance among these tests is particularly significant in older adults. At this time, unless there are clear clinical hyperglycemic symptoms, the ADA recommends verifying with two diagnostic tests for confirmation (eg, both FPG &gt; 125 mg/dL and A1C ≥ 6.5%). If a patient has discordant results on two different tests, then the test</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with the result higher than the diagnostic threshold should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis. For example, if FPG is less than 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) but A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, then A1C should be repeated, and if the repeat A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, then the person would be considered to have diabetes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The ADA criteria shown in <span class="s1">Table 99-1 </span>also define prediabetes, an earlier stage in the development of diabetes. People with prediabetes do not meet the criteria for diabetes, but have glucose levels that are higher than normal. These people are at increased risk for developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). People with prediabetes include those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or an A1C range of 5.7% to 6.4%. IGT is based on results of an OGTT, and IFG is defined from FPGs. The IFG category allows easy identification of some, but not nearly all, of the older individuals who would meet criteria for IGT if an OGTT were performed. There is no recommended age adjustment for the criteria for either IGT or IFG, as these criteria predict risk for subsequent diabetes and CVD similarly in older people.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic Testing for Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ADA 2021 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the 2019 Endocrine Society Guideline on Treatment of Diabetes in Older Adults (both evidence-based) recommend screening all individuals older than age 65 with FPG and/or A1C level to detect prediabetes or diabetes. The Endocrine Society Guideline further suggests obtaining a 2-hour glucose post–OGTT measurement in older people with prediabetes values to identify those who meet diabetes criteria (ie, IPH), especially in high-risk populations. The rationale for such screening includes the high rate of undetected diabetes mellitus in population studies and the strong evidence that early intervention delays the progression to diabetes in people with prediabetes, including those older than 60. The ADA standards and the Endocrine Society Guideline recommend follow-up screening every 2 to 3 years based on the patient’s situation. However, yearly follow-up testing of people at high risk should be considered (see <span class="s1">Table 99-3 </span>for high risk factors), especially those who meet criteria for prediabetes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>CRITERIA FOR ANNUAL SCREENING FOR DIABETES OR PREDIABETES IN HIGH-RISK OLDER ADULTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EPIDEMIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Type 2 diabetes is a growing worldwide problem, becoming the 10th leading cause of death globally in 2017. Although the death rate (deaths/100,000 persons) fell slightly in North America and most of Europe between 2007 and 2017, it has increased steadily in Asia, India, Mexico, and northern Africa. Both the prevalence of diabetes and the rate of new cases of diabetes are projected to increase in the next three decades. These projected increases are attributable to aging of the world’s population, increasing numbers of higher-risk ethnic groups, and people with diabetes living longer due to falling rates of cardiovascular deaths.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2019 based on death certificate records.

Overall, risk for death</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">among those with diabetes is about twice that of people with similar age but without diabetes.

Diabetic neuropathy is highly correlated with the duration of diabetes, and it is estimated that approximately 50% of patients with diabetes will eventually develop neuropathy. Clinical and subclinical neuropathies have been estimated to occur in 10% to 100% of diabetic patients, depending on the diagnostic criteria and patient populations examined.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In an older adult population, the presence of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus should be viewed as a risk factor for these complications, analogous to hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. The level of increased relative risk may appear modest on an individual level. However, since older people have by far the highest rates of these conditions, the increase in absolute risk is substantial. Thus a twofold relative risk increase as occurs for myocardial infarction, stroke, and ESRD, represents a very large number of added adverse outcomes in an older adult diabetes population. The risk for lower- extremity amputation is dramatically increased in older people with diabetes mellitus, approximately 10-fold greater than that for older people without diabetes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As a result of the growing number of older people with diabetes and their high risk for diabetes complications, diabetes is costly for the US health care system. Over $300 billion were spent on patients with diabetes in the United States in 2017, and the majority of these costs were for older adults with long-standing diabetes and severe complications. On average, people with diagnosed diabetes have medical expenditures approximately 2.3 times higher than those without diabetes: approximately $1 in $5 health care dollars is spent caring for someone with diagnosed diabetes and approximately $1 in $10 health care dollars is attributed to diabetes. The annual attributed health care cost per person with diabetes increases with age, primarily as a result of increased use of hospital inpatient and nursing facility resources, physician office visits, and prescription medications. For example, 63% of the inpatient hospital costs for diabetes are attributed to utilization by adults aged 65 or older compared to 30% and 6% by adults aged 45 to 64 and younger than 45, respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the rate of new onset of type 1 diabetes is relatively low in older people, the mechanism for type 1 diabetes does not appear to be different in this population. Usually, patients with type 1 diabetes have markers of immune destruction of pancreatic β-cells such as islet cell antibodies, antibodies to insulin, or other pancreatic β-cell–specific antibodies. There are also strong human leukocyte antigen associations.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Type 2 diabetes is by far the most prevalent form in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells is rarely observed. Limited pathologic investigation suggests that total β-cell mass may be moderately</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reduced, but severe loss of β-cell mass is uncommon. The pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is unknown, but it appears to occur as a result of a complex interaction among genetic, lifestyle, and aging influences, as illustrated in <span class="s1">Figure 99-4</span>. The heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes likely reflects the varying contributions of each of multiple factors to the development of hyperglycemia in a given individual or family.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 99-4. <span class="s5">Model for age-related hyperglycemia.

In normal people who do not meet criteria for either diabetes mellitus or IGT, there is a slight age-related increase in FPGs and a more dramatic slowing of return to normal of glucose levels following an oral glucose challenge.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Insulin Resistance</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is a decline in sensitivity to the metabolic effects of insulin with age. An age-related impairment of intracellular insulin signaling reduces insulin- mediated mobilization of glucose transporters, which are critical to glucose uptake and metabolism in insulin-dependent tissues such as muscle and fat. There is currently little evidence for an age-related impairment of insulin effects on protein or fat metabolism.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">An absolute or relative increase of body adiposity, particularly central body adiposity, has been well-documented with advancing age and appears to account in large part for the age-related increase in insulin resistance.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Decreased physical activity (PA) is associated with insulin resistance, and exercise training can improve insulin sensitivity. Thus, diminished PA in an older individual can also contribute to decreased insulin sensitivity. Both in animal studies and in humans, it has been difficult to demonstrate a residual effect of aging on insulin action when the changes in body composition and PA are controlled for.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Impaired Insulin Secretion</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in aging is characterized by progressive defects in pancreatic β-cell function. Animal studies have demonstrated an age-related decline in β-cell function. However, there has been great variability in previous studies examining insulin secretion in older people. These human studies, however, may have failed to address adequately the importance of the normal adaptive response to insulin resistance. As most older individuals demonstrate insulin resistance, a compensatory increase of insulin secretion, leading to increased circulating insulin levels, would be expected. However, both basal and stimulated insulin levels in older adults are similar to those of insulin- sensitive young people, suggesting an inadequate adaptive response to insulin resistance in older subjects. Furthermore, when older and younger people are carefully matched for degree of insulin sensitivity, absolute impairments in β- cell function are evident with normal human aging, as shown in <span class="s1">Figure 99-5</span>. Such defects are even greater in older people with prediabetes. Thus, impaired pancreatic β-cell adaptation to insulin resistance is an important contributing factor to age-related glucose intolerance and risk for diabetes.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 99-5. </span>Effect of age on insulin secretion rate (ISR) in humans with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) by American Diabetes Association criteria.

Hyperglycemia, in turn, is known to contribute directly to insulin resistance and to impair pancreatic β- cell function, thereby setting up a vicious cycle of maladaptive mechanisms.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Coexisting illness is another factor affecting both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in an older person. Both hypertension and hyperlipidemia are common in older people and have been associated with diminished insulin sensitivity. In fact, a metabolic syndrome has been described that includes coexisting hypertension, hyperlipidemia, central obesity, and glucose intolerance. Some have proposed that insulin resistance is a unifying feature linking the components of this metabolic syndrome; however, there is uncertainty about whether the insulin resistance in these circumstances is primary or a secondary result of these other conditions. Furthermore, any acute illness can precipitate hyperglycemia because of effects of stress hormones to cause insulin resistance combined with the α-adrenergic effects of catecholamines released during stressful illness to inhibit insulin secretion. Drugs that may be used by older people may also contribute to hyperglycemia by causing insulin resistance (see <span class="s1">Table 99-2</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A pathogenetic sequence common to many syndromes in old age can be readily illustrated by diabetes in an older patient: asymptomatic hyperglycemia over time becomes symptomatic, leading to acute complications and such syndromes as hyperosmotic nonketotic coma or, with time, to microvascular or macrovascular complications such as renal disease, stroke, or myocardial infarction. These events may in turn lead to superimposed drug treatment–induced aggravation of impaired glucose regulation and to decreased PA, progressive disability, and functional decline: that is, a downward spiral of mutually reinforcing conditions perhaps triggered by an event such as influenza or a fall that would be readily withstood by a younger person, especially a younger person without diabetes.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Genetics</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is a strong genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes mellitus. For example, the concordance rate for type 2 diabetes in identical twins is 75% or higher. However, the genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is polygenic, involving a number of variants, where each allele has a modest effect on the risk of disease in an individual person. Genome-wide association studies, linkage analysis, a candidate gene approach, and large-scale association</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">studies have already identified approximately 70 loci conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. These genetic alleles appear to affect the risk of type 2 diabetes primarily through impaired pancreatic β-cell function, reduced insulin action, or obesity risk. A goal of genetic testing would be to improve clinical prediction of an individual’s risk for developing diabetes, but this goal remains elusive.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mechanisms for Diabetes Complications</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chronic exposure to hyperglycemia may contribute directly to the development of diabetes complications in a number of ways. One mechanism may be the interaction of glucose with proteins to cause protein glycosylation and subsequent formation of advanced glycosylation end (AGE) products.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The AGE products can accumulate in proteins of slow turnover such as collagen, potentially leading to tissue damage and injury. Tissue exposure to high concentrations of glucose can also lead to accumulation of metabolic products of the aldose reductase system including nonmetabolized molecules such as sorbitol. Such accumulation can potentially affect cellular energy metabolism and contribute to cell injury and death. Given the complexity of the genetic background contributing to type 2 diabetes, the possibility also exists that some of the genetic background of an individual may directly contribute to the risk for one or more long-term complications of diabetes (eg, nephropathy) independent of the effects of hyperglycemia. However, such a possibility remains speculative. Interactions between diabetes and other comorbidities may contribute to the manifestation and severity of diabetes-related complications. Diabetic patients who also have hypertension are at greater risk for renal disease, retinopathy, and macrovascular disease than diabetic patients without hypertension. Similarly, neuropathy is more likely in a diabetic patient who is exposed to a neurotoxic agent. Growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, growth hormone, and transforming growth factor β, have been postulated to play important roles in the development of diabetic retinopathy.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PREVENTION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Type 2 diabetes is a gradually progressive disorder of carbohydrate metabolism that develops over a long period of time. It has been estimated that abnormalities of glucose regulation can be detected 8 to 10 years before the clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is made. Older adults have a high</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rate of prediabetes and other risks for progressing to type 2 diabetes in the next few years (eg, see <span class="s1">Table 99-3</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Effective means to delay progression to type 2 diabetes in high-risk people, such as those with prediabetes, have been identified. Intensive lifestyle interventions, which include weight loss and increased PA, can substantially reduce the rate of progression to type 2 diabetes in such high- risk people. Lifestyle intervention appears to be especially beneficial in prevention of progression to diabetes among older adults. For example, in the multicenter Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in the United States, a lifestyle intervention program including both caloric restriction and exercise was remarkably effective in reducing the rate of progression to type 2 diabetes, even though only 5% to 7% weight reduction was achieved. During the 3 years of active treatment in DPP, the lifestyle intervention program was more effective in people older than age 60 than in younger people, reducing progression to diabetes by more than 70% as compared to a control group, as shown in <span class="s1">Figure 99-6</span>. Metformin was also used in the DPP and was effective in slowing progression in younger adults, but had somewhat less effect in people older than age 60.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 99-6. </span>Diabetes incidence rates by age, Diabetes Prevention Program.

Overall, onset of diabetes was delayed by about 4 years by lifestyle intervention compared with placebo. Given the benefits observed in the DPP and other similar studies, both the ADA 2021 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the 2019 Endocrine Society Guideline recommend a lifestyle program similar to the DPP to delay progression to diabetes in patients aged 65 years and older who have prediabetes. Since 2018, a DPP- like lifestyle intervention is a covered benefit for Medicare beneficiaries in the United States who meet the criteria for prediabetes.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PRESENTATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The finding of an elevated glucose level on routine laboratory testing is the most common presentation for type 2 diabetes in an older person. The classical clinical hallmarks of diabetes are symptoms associated with marked hyperglycemia, including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weight loss. Older patients with type 2 diabetes may present with such symptoms, although it is relatively uncommon for them to do so, and the rate of emergency department visits by older adults for severe hyperglycemia have been declining. Some older patients may have sufficient hyperglycemia to cause mild classical symptoms, while others may have had gradual unexplained weight loss. Other older patients may present with atypical symptoms from hyperglycemia such as falls, urinary incontinence, fatigue, or confusion. Because type 2 diabetes may go undetected for years, some older adults first present with symptoms or findings related to diabetes complications, such as visual loss with classic retinopathy on examination, proteinuria, or symptomatic peripheral neuropathy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">With the profound insulin deficiency of type 1 diabetes, mobilization of fatty acids occurs leading to accelerated production of ketoacids, potentially resulting in life-threatening DKA. Although type 1 diabetes usually occurs in early life, it can occur at any age, including first presentation in an older patient. Development of DKA is the classic form of presentation for a patient with type 1 diabetes, but it is now recognized that people with type 1 diabetes may have long periods of abnormal circulating glucose levels before the development of DKA. Furthermore, with early detection of such</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hyperglycemia and appropriate diabetes management, an episode of DKA might never occur. An older person with type 1 diabetes may be particularly more likely to present with an indolent course.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diabetes mellitus is a complex disorder that can have effects on many body systems, and its treatment requires a complex program including lifestyle changes (eg, increase PA, healthy diet) and medications. The choice of intervention strategies and the patient’s capability to adhere to a treatment program may be limited by the presence of other health problems such as cognitive impairment, as well as by the patient’s living environment, economic status, availability of caregiver support, and the like. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 8</span>) is highly appropriate to provide the basis for developing a treatment plan for an older person with diabetes mellitus. Both the ADA and Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend assessing the overall health and personal values of older patients with diabetes, including multiple domains of health status and screening for geriatric syndromes, consistent with a Medicare annual wellness exam, as summarized in <span class="s1">Table 99-4</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-4 <span class="s3">■ </span>EVALUATION OF OLDER PATIENTS WITH DIABETES</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Medical Evaluation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once a diagnosis of diabetes is established, a thorough medical evaluation is needed. Because the risk for developing diabetes complications is related to the duration of hyperglycemia, effort should be made to pinpoint the time of onset. Unless patients at risk have been followed up carefully with yearly measurement of an FPG, as currently recommended, it may be difficult to establish a time of onset for type 2 diabetes in a given patient. Given the uncertainty about time of onset, a careful search for existing diabetes complications is warranted even when a new diagnosis is made in an older adult. Such an evaluation is even more justified in a patient with a multiyear history of diabetes mellitus who is establishing a new relationship with a health care system or primary care provider. The evaluation for <b>eye complications of diabetes </b>should be carried out by an ophthalmologist with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a detailed retinal examination, as early signs of diabetic retinopathy can easily be missed.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation of <b>DKD </b>should include a screening urine albumin and serum creatinine level, which should be followed at least annually. An elevated serum creatinine is a poor prognostic sign, suggesting that substantial kidney damage has already occurred and that an irreversible course of progressive renal insufficiency has already started. Albuminuria is a marker for kidney/glomerular disease as well as for CVD risk and is often the first clinical indicator of the presence of DKD. It is a clinically useful tool for predicting prognosis and for monitoring response to therapy. To confirm a diagnosis of increased albuminuria, it should be measured more than once and two of three samples should be elevated over a 3- to 6-month period.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The relationship of albuminuria to ESRD and CVD risk is a continuum, starting from “normal” levels less than 30 mg/g creatinine. Therefore, there is a trend to no longer refer to categorical nomenclature of “microalbuminuria” (30–300 mg/g creatinine) and “macroalbuminuria” (&gt; 300 mg/g creatinine). Depending on the patient’s overall situation, referral to a nephrologist may be warranted to assess other potential causes of renal insufficiency.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A careful neurologic examination should be carried out for signs of <b>diabetic neuropathy</b>. The 2021 ADA Guideline recommends that patients should be assessed for diabetic peripheral neuropathy starting at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and at least annually thereafter. Assessment for distal symmetric polyneuropathy should include a careful history and assessment of either temperature or pinprick sensation (small fiber function) and vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork (for large-fiber function). Annual 10-g monofilament testing should be done to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation. The neuropathy evaluation should be carried out in conjunction with a careful foot examination to identify possible structural abnormalities that might contribute to risk for skin breakdown and damage.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The medical evaluation of an older patient with diabetes should also include information about other <b>coexisting risk factors </b>including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and use of cigarettes. These conditions interact with diabetes to increase CVD risk and therefore need to be addressed in an overall patient management program. Blood pressure should be assessed both in the supine position and with upright posture, as an orthostatic drop in blood pressure may be another marker of diabetic neuropathy and is often</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">associated with supine hypertension. The genitourinary system should also be assessed, as patients with diabetes may be prone to bladder dysfunction associated with autonomic neuropathy, thereby increasing the risk for urinary tract infection and kidney damage. Sexual dysfunction has been reported in a high percentage of older men with diabetes, suggesting an interaction between aging, neuropathy, and vascular disease in this population.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A thorough evaluation of <b>the cardiovascular system </b>also should be carried out, given the high rate of CVD in older people with diabetes mellitus. The history and physical examination should carefully assess evidence for CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), and PVD. Suggestive history or physical findings should be documented with more in-depth testing including Doppler evaluation for carotid artery stenosis or extremity blood flow, or cardiovascular stress testing if there is any suggestion of coronary artery disease. Silent ischemia and myocardial infarction appear to be more common in people with diabetes mellitus. Thus, the threshold for stress testing should be rather low.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The <b>pharmacological history </b>of an older patient with diabetes is important both to identify drug therapy that may be contributing to the patient’s hyperglycemia (see <span class="s1">Table 99-2</span>), as well as to identify potential drug interactions that may affect diabetes management. The initial assessment should also include a diet history, a review of potential nutritional problems, and an oral health assessment, as dietary intervention is a key component of a treatment program for virtually all patients with diabetes. The assistance of a nutritionist who has a particular interest in diabetes is often very helpful for this part of the evaluation. Particular attention should be paid to dietary habits, ethnic food preferences, and meal patterns.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Evaluation Components</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diabetes knowledge <span class="p">Because of the complexity of diabetes management, usually requiring both lifestyle and medication interventions, the patient and/or caregivers must be actively involved in their own care and take responsibility for its many aspects. It is particularly important to review the patient’s knowledge base regarding diabetes and its complications.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Standardized diabetes knowledge tests are available, or an interview with a diabetes educator or suitably trained nurse can establish the status of the patient’s knowledge base. The diabetes education program that becomes part</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the treatment plan can then provide this base for new patients or fill in needed gaps for existing patients.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cognitive function <span class="p">Since diabetes and aging are each independently associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, older adults with diabetes are especially at high risk. Dementia, including both Alzheimer type and vascular type, is approximately twice as likely to occur in those with diabetes compared with age-matched nondiabetic people. Subtler impairments of cognition such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are also common.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cognitive impairment is associated with poorer glycemic control in clinical trials, and study participants with cognitive impairment had a higher risk for severe hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is also associated with higher risk for dementia. Therefore, both the ADA and Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend that older patients with diabetes should have periodic screening for cognitive impairment: at the time of diagnosis, then annually for those with borderline results initially or every 2 to 3 years when initial screening is normal. A positive screening test should be followed up by an appropriate diagnostic evaluation for dementia or MCI.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While advanced dementia may be identified in a routine clinical encounter, moderate cognitive impairment or MCI may be missed. Formal neuropsychological testing demonstrates that patients with diabetes frequently have unrecognized deficits in psychomotor efficiency, global cognition, and memory. They also frequently have abnormalities in cognitive function mediated by frontal lobes (executive function), which can affect their ability to perform complex behaviors such as attention, planning, organization, insight, reasoning, and problem solving. Such complex cognitive functions are necessary for diabetic patients to manage the complex treatment regimens for their disease. Early identification of cognitive impairment will help patients, their families, and health providers to individualize diabetes care regimens to set achievable diabetes goals without causing harm to the patients.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Functional status </span>Both aging and diabetes are risk factors for functional impairment, and people with diabetes have more functional impairment than those without diabetes. Both the ADA and Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend that review of activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living should be a part of the comprehensive assessment of an older patient with diabetes mellitus (<span class="s1">Table 99-4</span>). The presence of functional limitations must be considered in developing a diabetes treatment</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">program, as described below. In addition to general assessment of functional status, the ability of the patient and caregiver to carry out diabetes-specific functional tasks needs to be evaluated. For example, the ability to carry out home glucose monitoring or self-injection of insulin requires certain functional abilities.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overall health status <span class="p">The presence of other medical problems needs to be documented, as decisions about the extent of intervention for diabetes should be made in the context of the patient’s overall health situation, disease burden, and prognosis in terms of functional status and estimated longevity.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The presence of psychiatric disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder could have a major impact on the decision about diabetes treatment interventions. The relationship between depression and diabetes appears to be bidirectional. Depression is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (up to 60% higher per one meta-analysis). Individuals with diabetes have twice the rate of depression as those without diabetes, and older patients have higher mortality risk if they have both diabetes and depression. Other coexisting illnesses such as congestive heart failure or uncontrolled cancer may substantially limit a patient’s life expectancy, and thus may influence the decision about intensity of diabetes management.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MANAGEMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Approach</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The complexity of diabetes and its management requires a collaborative effort by a team of health providers, which may include physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and mental health professionals. Patients and family members must also assume an active role. There is increasing recognition of the importance of active collaboration between the patient’s geriatrics-oriented primary care team and an endocrinologist who focuses on diabetes care, with the role of each varying depending on the needs of the patient (see <span class="s1">Table 99-5</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>ROLES OF THE PRIMARY CARE TEAM AND ENDOCRINOLOGIST IN CARE OF OLDER PATIENTS WITH DIABETES</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The first key step in developing a diabetes management program for an older patient is to establish the treatment goals. Basic treatment goals for any patient with diabetes are to prevent metabolic decompensation and to control other risk factors that may contribute to long-term complications. Control of hyperglycemia as a means to reduce what some have termed glucose toxicity as a contributing factor to long-term diabetes complications is one part of an overall strategy of risk reduction. Such a strategy must include intensive effort at identifying and controlling hypertension, lipid disorders, and cigarette smoking among other risk factors (see section below on CVD risk reduction). Thus, a complex, multifaceted treatment program is important for many older patients with diabetes. As other chapters cover the management of hypertension (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 79</span>) and lipid disorders (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 74</span>), these will be referred to only briefly in this chapter. This chapter will focus on management of hyperglycemia. However, control of the traditional CVD risk factors is absolutely critical to successful diabetes management.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unfortunately, many studies have documented the overall lack of success of standard clinical practice in achieving these goals.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Any decision about the level of intensity for a treatment program must take into account coexisting conditions and the overall complexity of the patient’s medical regimen. For example, the existence of advanced diabetes complications in an older patient may provide a rationale for less strict goals for hyperglycemia or dyslipidemia. A significant psychiatric or cognitive disorder may also preclude an intensive management program. The target for hyperglycemia control might need to be higher for a patient at risk for severe hypoglycemia (see the section on “Hypoglycemia” later in this chapter). On the other hand, some older adults are able to devote a substantial amount of time to their own health care and are able to manage complex multidrug interventions for multiple health problems. Based on the initial comprehensive patient assessment as described here, many older adults with diabetes may fit in a category for which intensive treatment goals are appropriate.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It may be neither feasible nor appropriate to attempt to implement a complex diabetes management program for some patients. It is true that a limited remaining life expectancy shortens the time for long-term complications to develop and progress. However, given the increasing life expectancy of older adults, only the very oldest segment of the population or those with coexisting illness that markedly shortens remaining life expectancy should be excluded from consideration for an aggressive treatment program. For example, it would be hard to justify abandoning risk reduction goals in an otherwise healthy 75-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, as such a person’s remaining life expectancy may be 15 years or more. Given the potential complexity of treatment programs designed to minimize diabetes risks, the commitment on the part of an adequately informed patient is clearly critical. Availability of a supportive environment including a strong diabetes treatment team and adequate economic support for an intensive treatment program are also important. Such a treatment goal is also difficult to achieve without commitment of the health care team, which must believe that achievement of the treatment goal will really make a difference in the patient’s long-term health.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Information about a diabetic patient’s cognitive status, socioeconomic and living situation can also help guide the care plan for an older adult.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Limitations in cognition and economic support may affect the patient’s ability to adhere to the medical regimen. The health provider may need to simplify</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the diabetes regimen or loosen the glycemic and/or blood pressure targets to minimize risks for hypoglycemia and/or hypotension. The health provider may need to enlist the patient’s caregivers to be more involved in the patient’s care. The availability of caregivers in the home or nearby can compensate for some limitations in the patient’s self-care abilities and influence lifestyle factors that can affect diabetes management. For patients who have moderate or advanced cognitive impairment, support for basic home care will be needed either from family or more formal home care services or both, including the tasks of obtaining daily meals, administering medications and monitoring home glucose levels. Some patients may need to be transitioned from the home setting to assisted living facilities or long-term care facilities to receive necessary care. This decision will be influenced by their financial resources and the support of family members. The availability of a social worker or suitably trained nurse to assist in this aspect of the patient’s care program can be extremely helpful.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Several approaches have been proposed by diabetes specialists and geriatricians to better identify older adults who would benefit from more strict diabetes control versus less stringent management. Age alone is not a good marker, as age is a poor predictor of overall disease complexity and mortality risk. In <span class="s1">Figure 99-7</span>, a group of nationally representative older adults with diabetes were grouped by their comorbidities, physical function status, and cognitive status. While the oldest age group includes many people with very complex/poor health, over 50% of people older than 75 were relatively healthy by these criteria. Thus, a classification based on a patient’s comorbidities, physical function status, cognitive status, social support, history of hypoglycemia, etc can provide the basis for individualized goals to optimize the risk and benefit of diabetes treatments for a given patient. <span class="s1">Table 99-6 </span>provides such a framework to guide setting treatment goals for hyperglycemia in older adults with diabetes, published in the 2019 Endocrine Society Guideline (a similar framework is in the ADA 2021 Standards of Care). Based on the patient’s comorbidities, cognitive status, and physical function (as determined from the overall patient evaluation per <span class="s1">Table 99-4</span>), s/he may be categorized into one of the three groups. The Good Health group will likely benefit from more stringent glycemic management.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Intermediate Health group will likely have some difficulty in achieving stricter goals for glycemia. The Poor Health group of very complex patients</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">will likely not benefit greatly from intensive treatment of hyperglycemia so a less aggressive goal is more appropriate.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-6 <span class="s3">■ </span>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONSIDERING OVERALL HEALTH AND PATIENT VALUES IN DETERMINING CLINICAL TARGETS IN ADULTS AGED 65 AND OLDER</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 99-7. </span>Health status by age group of people over age 50 in the United States who have diabetes, based on data from the Health and Retirement Study.

People with diabetes benefit from receiving diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) when diabetes is diagnosed and as needed thereafter, such as when not meeting treatment targets. DSMES is an ongoing process of facilitating the knowledge, skills, and ability necessary for diabetes self-care. This process is evidence-based, and can be individualized for each patient, incorporating the needs, goals, and life experiences of the individual.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DSMES is associated with improved diabetes knowledge and self-care behavior, improved quality of life, lower A1C, and lower health care costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Recognizing the effectiveness and the need for DSMES, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and most insurance provide reimbursement for DSMES when the service meets the national standards and is accredited by either the ADA or the American Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists (ADCES). Yet, despite reimbursement, only 5% to 7% of individuals eligible for DSMES through Medicare or a private insurance plan actually receive it. The increased availability in telemedicine and internet-based health care may be an opportunity to reduce the barrier for patients to obtain DSMES.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of the risk factors for CVD among diabetic patients include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cigarette use, and age-related changes of the cardiovascular system including diminished vascular responsiveness (<span class="s1">Table 99-7</span>). Additional risk factors include obesity, insulin resistance, autonomic dysfunction, and inflammation. Individuals with diagnosed diabetes are at higher risk for CHD, and CHD risk also is elevated modestly among individuals with prediabetes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS AMONG OLDER ADULTS WITH DIABETES, IN ADDITION TO FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVEL</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hyperglycemia <span class="p">Initial interventions targeting hyperglycemia had limited or no benefit on CVD risk reduction for older adults with diabetes. In fact, the ACCORD trial was terminated early due to a higher rate of mortality in the intensively treated glycemic group. However, the results of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) required by the US FDA since 2008 (and later adopted by the European Medicines Agency) for new glucose lowering drugs have been much more encouraging. The required CVOTs must include higher risk patients including older adults and those with a history of CVD or other diabetes complications. As a result, the average age of study pwarticipants has been over 60. The CVOTs have established the CVD safety of three</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">major newer classes of glucose-lowering drugs: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, and sodium glucose transporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors. Furthermore, benefits for important CVD outcomes such as CVD deaths and new events, including subanalyses of the oldest age cohorts, were found in trials of three SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) and three GLP-1 agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide) currently in use in the United States. As all of these drugs result in modest weight loss (especially the</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GLP-1 agonists) and lower BP, the positive CVD outcomes observed cannot be ascribed solely to their glucose-lowering effects.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dyslipidemia (se e <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Table 99-8</span>) <span class="p">There are no large trials of lipid-lowering interventions specifically in older adults with diabetes. Trials of older adults at risk for CVD that include but are not limited to those with diabetes have shown consistent CVD benefits across the age spectrum. Several trials in adults with diabetes have demonstrated a beneficial effect of statins on lipid profiles and a reduction in CVD events, including subanalyses of the oldest age cohorts. As CVD prevention with statins, especially in people with prior CVD, is apparent within 1 to 2 years, statins may be indicated for nearly all older adults with diabetes except those with an end-stage disease and very limited life expectancy. For patients aged 75 years or older without atherosclerotic CVD, the benefit of statin therapy is still being studied.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-8 <span class="s3">■ </span>INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK IN OLDER ADULTS WITH DIABETES, IN ADDITION TO GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypertension (se e <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Table 99-8</span>) <span class="p">Lowering blood pressure from very high levels (eg, systolic blood pressure [SBP] 170 mm Hg) to moderate targets (eg, SBP 150 mm Hg) reduces CVD risk in older adults with diabetes. However, the ACCORD-BP trial showed no benefit on major CVD events of an SBP target less than 120 mm Hg compared with less than 140 mm Hg, but found a significant reduction in stroke. Other studies found no benefit when lowering SBP to less than 140 mm Hg, and low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (eg, &lt;</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">70 mm Hg) may actually be a risk factor for mortality in older adults. These findings contrast with those of SPRINT and other studies in older people without diabetes indicating added CVD protection with lower SBP targets (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 79</span>). Thus, the ideal BP target for older people with diabetes is controversial. However, both the 2021 ADA and 2019 Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend lowering BP to less than 140/90 for most older diabetes patients, with adjustments based on patient preference and overall health status. For example, a higher SBP target may be appropriate for some patients with poor health per <span class="s1">Table 99-6</span>. Conversely, some high-risk patients (eg, previous stroke or progressing CKD) could be considered for a lower BP target such as 130/80 mm Hg. If a lower BP target is selected, the patient should be carefully monitored to avoid orthostatic hypotension. Both the 2021 ADA and 2019 Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as first-line therapy for hypertension in older diabetes patients with evidence of nephropathy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aspirin (se e Table 99-8) <span class="p">As diabetes and aging both are associated with high CVD risk, and aspirin has well-known benefits for secondary prevention of CVD, aspirin therapy (75–162 mg) is recommended in both the 2021 ADA and 2019 Endocrine Society Guidelines for older adults with diabetes and known CVD. However, aspirin use remains controversial for primary prevention of CVD events in older adults with diabetes, as the benefits of aspirin may not outweigh the risk of adverse events such as bleeding.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prevention and Treatment of Microvascular Complications <span style=" color: #000;">Older adults are particularly overrepresented among those with</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">microvascular complications due to diabetes.

Assessment of renal function is important both for prevention of progression from early nephropathy to ESRD and for adjusting drug dosages of glucose lowering and other agents used in overall diabetes management. Lowering blood glucose levels reduces the risk of developing albuminuria and other microvascular diabetes</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">complications. There is no evidence that age of the patient limits this beneficial effect of glucose lowering. As ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce the rate of progression from microalbuminuria to overt proteinuria and diabetic nephropathy, one of them should be added to a treatment program for any patient who has evidence of nephropathy. Also, rigorous blood pressure control is particularly important for such individuals. However, as discussed above, for older adults with diabetes and nephropathy, the optimal blood pressure target remains unclear. CVOTs of two SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin and canagliflozin) and two GLP-1 agonists (liraglutide and semaglutide) found lower rates of nephropathy, as secondary outcomes; and one large canagliflozin trial focused primarily on nephropathy has reported positive outcomes. Thus, there is growing interest in use of these drugs both for treatment of hyperglycemia and for protection from progression of nephropathy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diabe tic re tinopathy (<span style=" color: #0000ED;">Figure 99-8</span>) <span class="p">As close surveillance for the existence or progression of retinopathy in patients with diabetes is crucial, both the 2021 ADA and 2019 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend an annual comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist. Retinopathy is generally classified as either nonproliferative or proliferative.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonproliferative retinopathy is characterized by nerve fiber layer infarcts (cotton wool spots), hard exudates, intraretinal hemorrhages, and microvascular abnormalities (microaneurysms, dilated, or tortuous vessels). Proliferative retinopathy is characterized by the formation of new blood vessels on the surface of the retina and can lead to vitreous hemorrhage. If proliferation continues, blindness can occur through vitreous hemorrhage and traction retinal detachment. With no intervention, visual loss may occur including progression to blindness. Laser photocoagulation and intravitreal injections of the anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) ranibizumab appear to be equally effective in prevention of visual loss in diabetic retinopathy. Macular edema may occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, especially in older adults. It is characterized by retinal thickening and edema involving the macula. Retinal edema may require intervention because it is sometimes associated with rapid visual deterioration. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept) provide effective treatment for central-involved diabetic macular edema and have largely replaced laser photocoagulation. Despite clear evidence of efficacy of retinopathy screening by ophthalmologic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">examination and appropriate intervention, many older diabetic patients do not receive recommended annual screening for retinopathy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 99-8. </span>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (<b>A</b>).

In addition, diabetic neuropathy increases the risk of postural instability, balance problems, and muscle atrophy, limiting PA and increasing the risk of falls. Therefore, neuropathy screening, vigilant foot care, and fall prevention are critically important for older diabetic patients. Patients with foot neuropathy should be referred to a podiatrist. Patients with neuropathy should be screened regularly for falls and if positive referred to physical therapy or a fall management program.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Diabetic neuropathy is classified into distinct clinical syndromes: distal symmetric polyneuropathy; autonomic neuropathy; thoracic and lumbar nerve root disease, causing polyradiculopathies; individual cranial and peripheral nerve involvement causing focal mononeuropathies, especially affecting the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) and the median nerve; and asymmetric involvement of multiple peripheral nerves, resulting in a mononeuropathy multiplex. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy may affect many organ systems and can be manifested by gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, anhidrosis, bladder dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, exercise intolerance, resting tachycardia, silent ischemia, and even sudden cardiac death. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is associated with increased risk of silent myocardial ischemia and mortality.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is no specific treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Management primarily consists of controlling hyperglycemia, which has been shown to be effective in clinical trials, pain control, fall risk reduction, and vigilant foot care. The 2021 ADA Guideline recommends pregabalin, gabapentin, and duloxetine for initial treatment of diabetic neuropathy pain. Other agents that are probably effective include amitriptyline, venlafaxine, tramadol, and local capsaicin. Lidocaine patch is possibly effective.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management of Hyperglycemia</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The A1C level is the primary tool for setting goals for hyperglycemia management and monitoring progress toward the goal for most patients. A</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">major challenge in diabetes management is that there is no single best A1C goal for all older adults with diabetes. The relationship between A1C and mortality appears to be U-shaped, rather than linear. Older patients with diabetes have lower risk for death or other complications at an A1C between 6% and 9%, but higher risk at both lower or higher A1C. As older adults with diabetes are highly heterogeneous with respect to their health status, the A1C goal should be individualized. The 2019 Endocrine Society Guideline provides a framework to begin individualizing the goals (see <span class="s1">Table 99-6</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This framework also provides glucose level targets throughout the day. An important recommendation of the Endocrine Society Guideline is that outpatient diabetes regimens be designed specifically to minimize hypoglycemia. Thus, this framework takes into account hypoglycemia risk, with lower limits set for A1C targets in at risk patients (eg, avoiding an A1C</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&lt; 7.5% for someone with Intermediate Health treated with insulin or a sulfonylurea drug). Providers should measure the A1C at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals, and more frequently for those not meeting glycemic goals or who have changes in their therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Providers should recognize that certain medical conditions can affect the usefulness of the A1C measurement (see discussion of the A1C test in the section on diagnostic criteria). Periodic measurement of glucose levels throughout the day complements the A1C test and allows detection of hypoglycemia in at-risk patients. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been increasingly used to improve glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemia for younger patients with type 1 diabetes. However, more recently CGM use showed benefit in people with type 1 diabetes older than age 60 and also in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Essential components of hyperglycemia management include patient self- monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), CGM for selected patients, and recognition and self-treatment of hypoglycemia. The ability to perform these tasks is especially important for those individuals at risk for hypoglycemia (ie, being treated with insulin or a sulfonylurea drug). Coexisting geriatric syndromes and comorbidities may create difficulties for older adults to handle these tasks. For example, individuals with hand arthritis may have difficulty operating the SMBG instruments, individuals with vision impairment may have difficulty reading the results, or individuals with cognitive impairment may have difficulty in reacting appropriately to treat hypoglycemia. Therefore, providers should routinely assess the patient’s</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ability to perform SMBG or CGM and to appropriately recognize and treat hypoglycemia.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic approaches</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exercise <span class="p">An exercise program is an important part of diabetes management, particularly for older patients. Exercise programs can be beneficial by helping to control hyperglycemia, improve physical functioning, reduce CVD risk factors, contribute to weight loss, and improve well-being. The ADA recommends that all adults with diabetes should perform at least 150 min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic PA, spread over at least 3 days/week with no more than 2 consecutive days without exercise. As part of the exercise routine, resistance training should be performed at least twice per week. Flexibility and balance exercises are also important in older adults with diabetes to maintain range of motion, strength, and balance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, over 60% of adults with type 2 diabetes are not physically active. Older adults are especially likely to be sedentary; only 12% of adults aged 75 or older engage in 30 minutes of PA 5 or more days per week, and 65% report no leisure PA. While many barriers to PA exist, health providers can also leverage motivators to improve exercise participation among older adults (<span class="s1">Table 99-9</span>). Many different PA intervention approaches currently exist, but no single type of intervention has been shown to be superior.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Furthermore, many older adults with chronic medical conditions and geriatric syndromes have been excluded from studies of PA interventions. Additional research on PA is needed to target older adults with diabetes who have functional limitations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-9 <span class="s3">■ </span>COMMONLY REPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BARRIERS AND MOTIVATORS BY OLDER ADULTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although exercise training alone has not had consistent effects to improve circulating glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus, it is a useful adjunct to drug therapy and may well contribute to enhanced effectiveness of glucose-lowering agents. Given the high prevalence of CHD and diabetic autonomic neuropathy in older patients with diabetes mellitus, which may be asymptomatic or atypical in symptoms, it is important for such patients to have medically supervised stress testing before entering any challenging exercise training program. Even PA at levels lower than usually recommended for cardiorespiratory conditioning (eg, &lt; 50% VO<span class="s11">2</span>max) may</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">enhance glucose tolerance, improve coronary risk factor profile, and reduce CVD-related mortality. Furthermore, patients with lower baseline PA status are likely to experience greater health benefit with a given increase in PA, especially with longer and/or more frequent exercise sessions. Thus, adults with diabetes may benefit from PA of lower intensity but longer duration and/or greater frequency.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Additional issues to consider in an older person participating in an exercise program include the potential for foot and joint injury with upright exercise such as jogging, unstable comorbidities, autonomic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy or foot lesions that may predispose to injures, and the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ability to promptly identify and treat hypoglycemia. Therefore, each patient’s exercise prescription needs to be individualized based on their capability to safely participate in an exercise program. A more detailed discussion of the effects of exercise training in older individuals is provided in <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 54</span>.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Obesity/Diet <span class="p">As part of diabetes management, the ADA recommends that overweight older adults with type 2 diabetes lose 5% to 7% of body weight through lifestyle changes. However, the benefits versus risks associated with weight loss in older patients with diabetes remain unclear. Among nondiabetic severely obese adults aged 65 or older, individuals who lost weight by caloric restriction and exercise had less reduction in lean muscle mass, increased bone density, and more improvement in physical function than individuals who lost weight by calorie restriction alone or by exercise alone. Therefore, a combination of calorie restriction and exercise may be the best approach for obese older adults with type 2 diabetes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Dietary intervention has long been a cornerstone of hyperglycemia management. However, there are many challenges with diet programs in older people (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 30</span>). The ADA currently recommends that medical nutrition therapy be included in any diabetes care program, but that it should be tailored for each patient. Fundamental to any dietary recommendation is ensuring that essential dietary needs are met with adequate provision of vitamins and minerals. Over the years, dietary supplements have been proposed to assist in diabetes treatment such as vitamins C, E, or B complex, or minerals such as zinc or chromium to replace possible diabetes-related losses, thereby improving the metabolic state and possibly reducing the rate of various complications. There is, however, no convincing evidence that any of these dietary supplements improves hyperglycemia control or influences diabetes complications. Two aspects of diet need to be addressed in any dietary program: the total caloric intake, which is a key to maintenance of body weight or weight reduction; and dietary composition, or the distribution of fat, carbohydrate, and protein calories.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Caloric intake. <span class="p">Caloric restriction is usually part of the initial approach to management of overweight patients with diabetes mellitus. Because it is generally desirable to maintain muscle and bone mass, the target of caloric restriction is reduction in adiposity, particularly the central adiposity that seems to be critical in mediating obesity-related insulin resistance. The widely accepted definition for obesity is a body mass index (BMI) over 30</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">kg/m<span class="s22">2</span> and for overweight is a BMI of 25 to 30 kg/m<span class="s22">2</span>. A serious effort at weight reduction should be considered for any obese, older diabetic patient and for many who are overweight as well. Because of an age-related decline in lean body mass, older individuals may have increased adiposity and central adiposity without being overweight or obese by usual BMI criteria.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Documentation of central adiposity by waist measurement or computed tomography may suggest a role for caloric restriction in such individuals. Relatively normal-weight people with central adiposity likely already have diminished lean body mass, which will be further threatened by caloric restriction. For individuals who are not overweight and who do not have central adiposity, caloric restriction should not be part of the hyperglycemia treatment program.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although many types of diets are successful in the short term in achieving weight reduction, long-term maintenance of weight reduction continues to be a major challenge. Some individuals are able to lose a significant amount of weight and maintain it. Therefore, patients should be offered assistance with caloric restriction and supported for a weight loss program. In general, behavioral modification to change dietary habits is the most successful approach long term. Relatively modest weight reduction can have a significant impact on the degree of insulin resistance and on control of glucose levels. Part of the approach should be to set a realistic goal of no more than 5% to 10% reduction of body weight, even if that will not achieve a normal BMI. The role for medications to assist weight loss in an older person with diabetes mellitus is uncertain. With the current explosion of knowledge about regulation of food intake in relation to obesity, it is likely that new medications will appear in the future to assist in weight reduction.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For example, the GLP-1 agonist oral semaglutide reduces caloric intake and was approved by the US FDA in 2021 for weight loss.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diet compos ition. <span class="p">The average American diet includes approximately 45% of calories as carbohydrate, 40% as fat, and 15% as protein. Limited research exists concerning the ideal amount of fat for individuals with diabetes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People with diabetes should follow the guidelines for the general population for the recommended intakes of saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, and trans fat. Increased consumption of foods containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids is recommended.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Consistency of dietary intake in terms of meal composition, carbohydrate intake, and timing is particularly an issue in patients treated with insulin. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ADA’s diet exchange program is one means of providing guidance to such patients to maintain consistency of dietary intake. Nutritional counseling can be particularly helpful in assisting patients to adhere to a dietary program.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dietary is s ues in older people. <span class="p">Caloric restriction is appropriate for healthier overweight and obese older patients as part of diabetes management.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, it is not appropriate for some older patients who are in a catabolic state due to undernutrition and comorbidities, meet criteria for frailty, or are generally in poor health (see <span class="s1">Table 99-6</span>). For such persons, more pressing dietary issues are eating regularly and coordinating food intake with administration of glucose-lowering agents appropriately to avoid hypoglycemia. Both the 2019 Endocrine Society and 2021 ADA guidelines recommend diets rich in protein and energy to prevent malnutrition and weight loss in older diabetes patients who meet criteria for frailty. As summarized in <span class="s1">Table 99-10</span>, there are a number of special issues that increase an older adult’s vulnerability to poor dietary habits. Older adults with a significant mobility limitation and/or lacking transportation are likely to have limited access to healthy and fresh food. Thus, convenient pre- prepared foods with high calorie, high cholesterol, and high sodium levels may become staples of an older patient’s diet, thereby interfering with good diabetes management. Older persons, especially men living alone, may have limited food preparation skills. The presence of impaired cognitive function may make following a dietary prescription particularly difficult.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Furthermore, dietary habits established for a lifetime and often with a</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cultural background may be particularly difficult to modify. Problems with taste and oral health, including xerostomia and periodontal disease, are common in older adults (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 32</span>), can be exacerbated by diabetes, and may further limit adaptation to a prescribed diet. Social isolation (ie, living alone, eating alone), poverty, and functional reliance on others to purchase food are all risk factors for decreased food intake. A social worker may be able to help older adults to access resources from local community social services organizations and involve the patient’s caregivers to improve the dietary support.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-10 <span class="s3">■ </span>DIETARY THERAPY: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Glucose -lowe ring drugs </span>A growing range of therapeutic options enables the treatment program to be tailored to the specific situation of the individual patient, as determined in part by the initial comprehensive assessment carried out.

Note that among the 12 classes of drugs available, only insulin and sulfonylureas pose a significant risk for hypoglycemia.

style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Noninsulin Agents <span class="p">A growing number of medications other than insulin are available for hyperglycemia management of older adults with diabetes</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mellitus. <span class="s1">Table 99-11 </span>lists the available drugs with their common dosages, mechanism of action, and advantages and disadvantages.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As the different classes of drugs have different mechanisms of action, there is increasing opportunity to individualize therapy as more is learned about the heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes. All of these agents are effective in lowering glucose levels in clinical trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some of them may also assist in lowering glucose levels as an adjunct to insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. The potential risks associated with these agents must be considered in relation to the patient’s comorbidities and their hypoglycemia risks.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Biguanide. <span class="p">Metformin is widely recommended as the first-line oral medication for hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes unless there is a specific contraindication. Metformin primarily suppresses hepatic glucose production and may also enhance peripheral sensitivity to insulin. Metformin rarely causes hypoglycemia when used alone. The most common side effect of metformin is gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, which in some patients can be associated with decreased appetite and modest weight loss. While some have viewed this as a potential benefit for a patient on a weight-reduction program, this effect needs to be balanced against the degree of symptoms and the appropriateness of decreased caloric intake and weight loss in a given individual. The biguanide class of drugs is also known to be associated with development of life-threatening lactic acidosis under some circumstances.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although this complication appears to be very rare in patients using metformin, this drug should be avoided in situations that may put people at risk for development of lactic acidosis: unstable congestive heart failure and during acute hospitalization for any major illness that could result in decreased tissue perfusion as a precipitating factor for lactic acidosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Metformin is contraindicated in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="s22">2</span>. Monitoring of renal function and perhaps dose adjustment of metformin to account for reduced renal clearance is highly appropriate for older diabetes patients with CKD.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">S<span class="s255">ULFONYLUREA DRUGS </span>. <span class="p">Sulfonylurea drugs have been on the market for many years and are still commonly used in older adults with type 2 diabetes. As first-generation sulfonylureas are rarely used, </span><span class="s1">Table 99-11 </span><span class="p">only includes second-generation agents. Because of their long history, there is a substantial body of knowledge about the mechanism of action and side effect profile of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sulfonylureas. Their primary mechanism of action is to enhance insulin secretion by the β-cells of the endocrine pancreas.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Sulfonylurea drugs have established a long record of safety, with hypoglycemia being the main adverse effect. Conservative dosing is recommended for older people. Glyburide has been associated with a higher risk for hypoglycemia in older patients due to its long half-life, so is not recommended in this population. Glipizide may be safer to use in older patients, but all of these drugs should be avoided if there is concern about hypoglycemia. These drugs should not be used in patients with renal insufficiency or with significant liver disease, as they depend on the liver for metabolism and the kidney for excretion. Hyponatremia has also been observed as a complication in some patients. Because of similar risk with use of thiazide diuretics, the combination of thiazide and sulfonylurea drugs should be avoided if hyponatremia is a concern.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agents . <span class="p">GLP-1 is an incretin, an intestinal hormone that is released with meals and causes glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Two classes of GLP-1 drugs are used clinically.</span></p><p class="s254" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors <span class="p">Native incretin hormones such as GLP-1 have very short half-lives as they are degraded by the enzyme, DPP-4, and thus cannot be used therapeutically. Inhibitors of DPP-4 are orally effective agents that increase and prolong the action of endogenous incretin hormones, and several are now available. These agents are used once daily and result in modest reductions of A1C. Used alone, they rarely cause hypoglycemia, as GLP-1’s effect on insulin secretion is reduced as glucose levels fall. They do not cause weight loss, but may have a few nonspecific side effects including nasopharyngitis and headache. Safety and efficacy studies in older people show no overall differences compared to use in younger patients.</span></p><p class="s254" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">GLP-1 agonists <span class="p">are analogs of GLP-1 that are much less susceptible to DPP-4 and so provide prolonged GLP-1 effects. When they are used in pharmacologic doses, they are potent enhancers of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. They also suppress glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying, and reduce food intake, usually resulting in some loss of body weight. Overall, they usually lead to greater reductions of A1C than DPP-4 inhibitors. Like DPP-4 inhibitors, they rarely cause hypoglycemia. Current GLP-1 agonists require injection, except semaglutide, which is also available for oral use.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exenatide is a peptide derived from frog skin that has GLP-1 agonist activity.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is now a long-acting form of exenatide that can be administered once a week. More recent GLP-1 agonists are actual modifications of GLP-1 itself. There are now fixed injectable combinations available of insulin with a GLP-1 agonist (insulin glargine/lixisenatide and insulin degludec/liraglutide), see <span class="s1">Table 99-11</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Given the clinically significant cardiovascular and possibly nephropathy benefits of some GLP-1 agonists (see <span class="s1">Table 99-11</span>), they are recommended for patients who have not achieved adequate glycemic control with metformin alone, especially among patients with previous CVD or CKD. Side effects of GLP-1 agents include nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, and weight loss, which may be particularly undesirable for some older adults. There are reports of possible associated acute pancreatitis with GLP- 1 agents, and development of C-cell hyperplasia or medullary thyroid tumors in animals.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SGLT-2 <span class="s255">INHIBITORS </span>. <span class="p">Two sodium glucose transporters (SGLT) cause glucose reabsorption: SGLT-1 and SGLT-2. SGLT-2 is found only in the proximal tubule of the kidney, and accounts for 90% of the reabsorption of glucose. SGLT-1 is found in the gut and other tissues, and accounts for approximately 10% of glucose reabsorption. SGLT-2 inhibitors are oral agents that lower glucose levels in patients with diabetes by increasing urinary excretion of glucose. They are used once daily, result in modest lowering of A1C, and rarely cause hypoglycemia. These agents have cardiovascular benefits in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD and heart failure, and slow the progression of CKD, including in older patients per secondary analyses of CVOTs. However, they are contraindicated if the eGFR is below 30</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mL/min/1.73 m<span class="s22">2</span>.

This volume effect may contribute to increased risk for DKA in susceptible patients. There is increased risk for genital yeast infection and urinary tract infection, likely due to the induced glucosuria. Because of these side effects and relatively high cost, some older patients may not be able to use these agents.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">α-G<span class="s255">LUCOS IDAS E INHIBITORS </span>. <span class="p">These agents work by inhibiting the key GI enzyme responsible for breakdown of carbohydrates prior to absorption.

The major side effects are local to the GI tract (flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain) because these drugs are not absorbed to any significant degree. These agents may be useful and relatively safe in older people with fairly well-controlled diabetes.

This mechanism of action complements that of the other drug classes available. As peripheral resistance to insulin is a key part of the metabolic syndrome that predisposes to development of diabetes, use of a drug that targets this abnormality is attractive. These drugs have been shown to have similar efficacy and adverse events in older adults. However, they can cause fluid retention, peripheral edema, weight gain, and increase the risk for congestive heart failure, so should not be used in patients with heart failure. Use of these agents should also be avoided in patients at risk for osteoporosis, falls or fractures, and/or macular edema.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meglitinide and D-phenylalanine derivative. <span class="p">Both repaglinide and nateglinide act directly on pancreatic β-cells to rapidly stimulate insulin secretion, but by a mechanism that differs from the sulfonylureas. Both drugs were designed to be used immediately before meals and both improve postprandial glucose levels. No dose adjustments are necessary in older people. Repaglinide should not be combined with gemfibrozil because of increased repaglinide levels. Nateglinide has no known drug interactions, and can be used in patients with renal insufficiency.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Drugs <span class="p">Three other types of drugs are approved for lowering glucose levels: the bile acid sequestrant colesevelam, the dopamine-2 agonist bromocriptine, immediate-release form (Cycloset), and pramlintide acetate (Symlin), an injectable analog of the peptide amylin available in the United States that reduces postprandial glucose in conjunction with mealtime insulin. Because of limited experience with these drugs (especially in older adults) and modest glucose lowering, they are rarely used.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combination Therapy <span class="p">Combinations of oral agents or a combination of one or more of these oral/injectable agents with insulin are theoretically attractive because of the different modes of action of the various classes of drugs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thus, combination therapy addresses various aspects of the pathophysiology of hyperglycemia in diabetes, offering the possibility of synergism in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">therapeutic efficacy without synergism in toxicity. For older patients, the logic of combination therapy must be balanced against incremental costs and incremental risks of side effects with each additional drug. Furthermore, the potential for polypharmacy for multiple coexisting conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, and coronary artery disease needs to be considered. The overall treatment goal for the patient must also be kept in mind. Adding a second or third oral or injectable agent without achieving the glycemic goal can be an indication to proceed to use of insulin.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Insulin Therapy <span class="p">Use of insulin is required in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin also may be needed in patients with type 2 diabetes either as part of an outpatient glucose-lowering regimen or to maintain reasonable glucose control in the hospital setting (usually managed by an inpatient diabetes care team) during acute stressful illness or in the perioperative period when oral agents may be less acceptable or useful.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advantages of ins ulin. <span class="p">There are now more than 100 years of clinical experience with use of insulin since its discovery in 1922 and the dramatic demonstration of its effectiveness to save the lives of patients with type 1 diabetes in DKA. Many formulations of insulin with varying duration of action allow individualization of treatment plans. Insulin is the natural hormone that is deficient in relative or absolute terms in diabetes, so its use fits with the overall concept of hormone replacement for endocrine deficiency syndromes. Virtually all forms of insulin currently in use are identical to human insulin or with only slight molecular modifications, so the incidence of allergic reactions is very small. There are virtually no known pharmacokinetic drug interactions and virtually no absolute contraindications to insulin use.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">With appropriate dosage modification and monitoring of glucose levels, insulin can be used safely for patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency, patients unable to eat, and during major illness. Insulin itself is relatively inexpensive. However, the overall program of insulin treatment, including use of modern insulin analogs and frequent glucose monitoring, may be expensive. While appropriate insulin use can be a challenge, it encourages active self-care by the patient and/or caregivers. Finally, and perhaps most important from the point of view of achieving treatment objectives, insulin can effectively lower glucose levels in virtually any patient and, in sufficient</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dosage, has at least the potential to normalize circulating glucose levels if the regimen intensity is sufficient.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dis advantages of ins ulin. <span class="p">One disadvantage of insulin is that it requires injection to be effective, although approval of Afrezza (human insulin) Inhalation Powder provides a rapid-acting insulin option for patients unable or unwilling to perform injections. Injection may represent an insurmountable psychological barrier for a small number of patients. For others, insulin injections may not be feasible owing to functional limitations or insufficient caregiver support. Most older adults can, however, be trained to use insulin appropriately. Insulin is a potent agent, and so the dose must be carefully measured to minimize risk of hypoglycemia. Accidental overdose is also a risk. The most common issue to address with insulin management is risk for hypoglycemia, which is discussed below.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I<span class="s255">NS ULIN REGIMENS </span>. <span class="p">Before prescribing any insulin, the provider should have a good understanding of the different duration of each agent’s glucose-lowering effect. As described in </span><span class="s1">Table 99-12</span><span class="p">, insulin agents have variable onset of action, peak effect, and duration of action; these characteristics are important when selecting which agent to prescribe. Long-acting agents are modified to slow degradation, and have a stable time course of action over 24 hours, so can be given once daily for basal insulin replacement. These long-acting insulin analogs can improve management of diabetic patients, with a relatively low incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia (especially the two ultra–long-acting agents), no pronounced peak, a long duration of action, and little interpatient absorption variability. Insulin glargine can be dosed as 0.2 units/kg/day subcutaneously once daily or initiated at 10 units once daily and adjusted as needed. Insulin detemir (Levemir) can be initiated at 0.2 to 0.5 unit/kg/day (0.1 to 0.2 unit/kg/day for insulin-naïve patients) with one injection daily in the evening or at bedtime.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-12 <span class="s3">■ </span>INSULIN FOR TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Insulin aspart (NovoLog), insulin lispro (Humalog), and insulin glulisine (Apidra) were developed as agents with a very rapid onset and short duration of action. These insulins are used for injection just prior to meals and are less likely to result in postmeal hypoglycemia than human regular insulin. They can even be given within 20 minutes after starting a meal. Thus, a combination of once-daily, long-acting insulin analog plus premeal injections of a rapid-acting insulin analog may be used for intensive insulin therapy. Similar results can be achieved with such a regimen as with use of a subcutaneous insulin pump system delivering a continuous basal insulin infusion plus bolus injections with meals. Intensive insulin therapy of selected older adults with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes using either of these two regimens achieved an average hemoglobin A1C of 7% over a period of 1 year with minimal adverse effects.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Initiation of ins ulin therapy. <span class="p">In developing an insulin treatment regimen for an older adult, it is useful to keep in mind a target total dose range per 24 hours, even though the initial starting dose may be substantially lower. The total daily insulin dose required for a thin patient with type 1 diabetes is typically</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">0.5 to 1.0 units/kg. The total daily insulin dose for a type 2 diabetes patient with insulin resistance may vary considerably, but up to 1.0 to 2.0 units/kg may be needed to achieve the glucose control target selected. For most such patients, insulin should be initiated at a much lower dose, such as 0.1 to 0.2 units/kg/day. Of course, there will be substantial variation among individuals in total dose needed, depending on the target treatment goal, patient adherence to lifestyle modification recommendations, degree of insulin resistance, and individual variation of insulin dose pharmacokinetic patterns. Thus, a low starting dose of a single injection of long-acting insulin 10 to 20 units daily, depending on the degree of obesity, is reasonable. Initiation of insulin treatment is usually done as an outpatient and in conjunction with a diabetes education program for the patient and family members.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Frequent follow-up should be provided initially to ensure that the treatment program is progressing smoothly and that hypoglycemia does not occur early on. Given the metabolic stability of most older patients with type 2 diabetes, there is no need to escalate the insulin dose rapidly. Doses can be adjusted in 2- to 5-unit increments every 3 to 5 days (or every 7 days for long-acting insulin analogs) while glucose levels are being monitored.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients should be prepared from the outset to progress to at least two injections per day, although some patients may achieve the treatment goal with a single dose.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As insulin doses continue to be gradually adjusted upward, an obese patient with type 2 diabetes may need a total of more than 100 units/day to achieve an aggressive treatment goal. Also, as doses are increased, it makes sense to add use of a rapid-acting insulin to help cover meal-related increases of glucose levels.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As glucose levels are reduced, insulin sensitivity will likely improve owing to amelioration of the direct effects of hyperglycemia. Thus, an overweight older patient who appears relatively unresponsive to a moderate dose of insulin initially may begin to respond dramatically to modest further increases of insulin dose. In fact, the patient may progress to having episodes of hypoglycemia even with reduction to a total insulin dose that previously was not very effective. It is apparent that close follow-up with the diabetes</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">care team, careful attention to glucose monitoring, and coaching about symptoms of hypoglycemia are all critical to a successful treatment program. A suitably trained diabetes nurse educator can play a particularly critical role during this phase of treatment.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combination of ins ulin and nonins ulin agents . <span class="p">Insulin therapy can be combined with use of one or more other classes of glucose-lowering drugs, although there are little data on such regimens specifically in older adults. One option is use of an evening or bedtime injection of a long-acting insulin analog to target control of the FPG plus use of another drug for daytime use.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There are theoretical advantages to combining insulin with a drug that induces weight loss such as a GLP-1 agonist or with an agent that reduces meal-related glucose excursions. However, insulin regimens alone with dose adjustments can achieve remarkably similar control of hyperglycemia as combinations of lower doses of insulin with another class of drug. Given the limited incremental cost of additional insulin to a patient already on insulin and the potential for adverse drug reaction with any addition of a different therapeutic agent, the practical gain of such combination therapy remains unclear.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Another theoretical advantage of combination therapy is that lower doses of insulin can be used to achieve similar glycemic control. It has been argued that high doses of insulin may have adverse cardiovascular effects, but no convincing data links dose of insulin in patients with diabetes to adverse cardiovascular effects. A concern about using a high dose of insulin is the potential for weight gain. For patients for whom the indication for insulin is a period of substantial weight loss caused by decompensated diabetes, insulin therapy should be expected to cause weight gain back toward baseline with accompanying restoration of lean body mass. For other patients, it may be necessary to balance the potential risk of weight gain versus the benefit of substantial lowering of circulating glucose levels. In general, weight gain with insulin therapy is modest (in the range of a few kilograms) except for those individuals who have lost substantial weight prior to insulin therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By emphasizing and reinforcing lifestyle modifications as insulin therapy is instituted, substantial weight gain can generally be avoided.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Follow-up care and quality indicators <span class="p">Diabetes mellitus is a complex disease that requires long-term follow-up and involves multidisciplinary health providers. Key items to document in routine diabetes follow-up care are</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">summarized in <span class="s1">Table 99-13</span>. For patients with type 1 diabetes or with type 2 diabetes who have an aggressive treatment goal or with multiple diabetes complications, participation by a specialized diabetes care team in the overall management program should be carefully considered. As a means to standardize and improve the quality of health care for diabetic patients, a number of health insurance providers, including the CMS, have adopted measurements to assess the quality of diabetes care. These measures are designed to assess the care of groups of patients in a given care setting, not the care of individual patients. Furthermore, these quality measures do not include all older patients, some measures are not appropriate for patients with poor health status, and measures that may have a larger impact on an older adult’s safety are not included. For example, patients older than age 75 are traditionally excluded from such quality assessment. While the quality measures routinely include the proportion of patients with poor glycemic or blood pressure control (ie, A1C &gt; 9% or blood pressure &gt; 135/90 mm Hg), virtually none of them currently assess the proportion of patients with hypoglycemia events or hypotension events. Diabetes quality measures that are based on the health status of the patient rather than age may be more appropriate for older patients given their heterogeneous health status.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:65.2pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">TABLE 99-13 <span class="s3">■ </span>KEY COMPONENTS OF ROUTINE FOLLOW-UP CARE (USUALLY EVERY 1–3 MONTHS) FOR OLDER PATIENTS WITH DIABETES<span class="s21">A</span></p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SPECIAL ISSUES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypoglycemia</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypoglycemia is the primary short-term risk of a hyperglycemia treatment program that includes a sulfonylurea drug or insulin, particularly one that is targeted at achieving near-normal control of glucose levels. In the absence of a sulfonylurea drug or exogenous insulin, neither metformin nor the newer classes of glucose lowering drugs cause hypoglycemia. The GLP-related drugs stimulate significant insulin secretion only when glucose levels are elevated. Similarly, the SGLT-2 antagonists enhance renal excretion of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">glucose primarily when glucose levels are elevated and are minimally effective as glucose levels approach the normal range.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Multiple mechanisms exist to maintain adequate circulating glucose levels because glucose is a fuel particularly targeted to meet the needs of the brain and other tissues that are not dependent on insulin for glucose uptake. Muscle and fat, the major peripheral tissues, have a glucose transport system that primarily depends on insulin for activation. Brain cells, however, have a different type of glucose transporter molecule that is continually expressed on the cell surface and does not depend on insulin for activation. After an overnight fast, when insulin levels are low, the brain does not have to compete with other major tissues for access to glucose. This is in contrast to fat-related fuel such as free fatty acids and ketones, which have ready access to muscle and fat tissue and therefore are less available to the brain. Because of the brain’s dependency on glucose as a fuel, it is particularly vulnerable to injury from hypoglycemia, a fact that must be carefully considered as the overall benefits and risks of a diabetes treatment program are reviewed.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thus, an older diabetic adult on a glucose-lowering regimen that includes a sulfonylurea drug or insulin must be counseled to always carry glucose tablets or food. An older adult on insulin therapy and their family or caregiver should be given a glucagon emergency kit and teaching on its use.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Hypoglycemia counterregulation </span>Hypoglycemia can be the result of absolute therapeutic hyperinsulinemia alone, but more commonly is the result of compromised physiologic and behavioral defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations in the presence of unregulated insulin levels due to a sulfonylurea drug or exogenous insulin. <span class="s1">Table 99-14 </span>lists factors that are important in recovery from hypoglycemia by increasing the glucose level either from endogenous sources or from ingestion of glucose. The major source of endogenous glucose is the liver. The liver contributes to recovery from hypoglycemia by increasing glucose production under the influence of counterregulatory hormones. As the insulin effect fades during insulin- induced hypoglycemia, there is a decline in peripheral glucose uptake, preserving more circulating glucose for recovery. The degree of fall of glucose levels determines the magnitude of counterregulatory responses and the speed with which normal glucose levels can be restored. Normally, there is a hierarchy of responses to hypoglycemia with release of counterregulatory hormones such as epinephrine and glucagon occurring before a patient becomes symptomatic and aware of hypoglycemia. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">initial symptoms are caused by autonomic nervous system activation with tachycardia, nervousness, and a sweating response, all of which can alert the patient to the need to seek exogenous sources of glucose to facilitate recovery. Hunger is often a part of this behavioral response. However, as glucose levels fall lower and brain cell function becomes compromised, confusion, lethargy, and progression to coma can occur. Fortunately, the response to glucose administration is quick, and dramatic recovery normally occurs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-14 <span class="s3">■ </span>FACTORS AFFECTING RECOVERY FROM HYPOGLYCEMIA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It is now recognized that the history of the glucose level that the brain is exposed to influences the counterregulatory response mechanisms, perhaps by affecting the brain glucose transport system. For example, there appears to be adaptation to chronic hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, with resulting elevation of the glucose level at which counterregulatory responses begin to occur. Thus, a patient with diabetes may begin to develop symptoms of hypoglycemia at a glucose level in the range of 80 to 100 mg/dL, well above the symptomatic threshold in nondiabetic individuals of 50 to 60 mg/dL. Conversely, the brain appears to adapt to low glucose levels as well, with a shift downward of the glucose threshold for activation of counterregulatory responses. Prior exposure to hypoglycemia leads to diminished counterregulatory hormone responses. This can set up a vicious cycle by which patients are less able to counterregulate hypoglycemia and have more recurrent episodes. A key issue seems to be that as the glucose threshold for counterregulation drops, it becomes perilously close to glucose levels that can adversely affect brain function. Thus, a patient may have a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">very narrow margin for error, proceeding from relatively normal function without symptoms to profound hypoglycemia and loss of consciousness. This so-called hypoglycemia unawareness syndrome is in part iatrogenic in origin and generally responds to strict avoidance of hypoglycemia.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Hypoglycemia in older patie nts with diabetes </span>Hypoglycemia is dangerous for older patients as it is associated with increased risks for falls and dementia, and it can be fatal. Therefore, episodes of hypoglycemia should be ascertained and addressed at routine visits for any patient receiving a sulfonylurea drug or insulin. A self-reported history of severe hypoglycemia (requiring the assistance of another person) predicts increased mortality 5 years later. ED visit rates for hypoglycemia are highest among adults with diabetes aged 75 or older, almost three times as high as in patients aged 45 to 64 (see <span class="s1">Figure 99-2</span>). Thus, prevention of hypoglycemia among older adults should be an important priority in the management of diabetes. <span class="s1">Table 99-15 </span>summarizes the risk factors for hypoglycemia in an older patient with diabetes. The primary risk factor is iatrogenic: prescription of insulin or a sulfonylurea.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other risk factors are physiologic changes associated with aging, which may be difficult to prevent, and health behaviors that can be modified through targeted interventions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-15 <span class="s3">■ </span>RISK FACTORS FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA IN OLDER DIABETIC PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Impairment of autonomic nervous system reflexes can contribute to risk for hypoglycemia. Aging is associated with a decrease in β-adrenergic receptor function, which is an important part of the body’s counterregulation to combat hypoglycemia. As a result, the sympathoadrenal system that stimulates catecholamine secretion to induce the rapid elevation of blood glucose levels is less effective. Some older patients may have autonomic neuropathy because of long-standing diabetes or other causes, and many older patients are treated with antiadrenergic agents for CVD. For example, β-adrenergic blocking drugs can potentially interfere with counterregulation of hypoglycemia. Given the substantial benefit of β-adrenergic blockade to patients with CVD, combination with insulin or a sulfonylurea should be avoided and other glucose-lowering drugs used if possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Fortunately, the counterregulatory system is redundant. Glucose counterregulation can be maintained quite well as long as there is an adequate glucagon response even when the adrenergic nervous system is blocked. However, normal aging is associated with reduced glucagon responses to hypoglycemia, and older adults with type 2 diabetes have</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">further impairment in glucagon responses to hypoglycemia when compared to age-matched control subjects. The growth hormone response to hypoglycemia is reduced with normal aging, and it is also further impaired in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Epinephrine and cortisol responses are similar or reduced in older adults with type 2 diabetes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients who have relatively poor nutrition and an irregular meal pattern are at increased risk of hypoglycemia, in part because of inadequate maintenance of muscle and liver glycogen stores. Use of alcohol or a sedating agent should be avoided in patients receiving hypoglycemic agents, particularly if an aggressive treatment program is being pursued. Clearly, a cognitive disorder will interfere with recognition of hypoglycemia and possibly affect decisions about responding to hypoglycemia. Patients with underlying renal or hepatic insufficiency may have problems eliminating insulin or a sulfonylurea. Insulin is partly cleared by the kidney, and the insulin dose must often be reduced substantially in patients with renal insufficiency. A patient with severe hepatic insufficiency may have difficulty mobilizing a counterregulatory increase of glucose production. Finally, any complex drug regimen may include agents that influence the pharmacokinetics of insulin or a sulfonylurea, or counterregulatory or behavioral responses to hypoglycemia, and therefore should be an issue when considering risk for hypoglycemia. Older adults often have impairments in vision, dexterity, and mobility, which may limit their ability to self-monitor for hypoglycemia and react quickly to avoid more disastrous consequences.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Despite all these issues and concerns, the availability of newer drug classes means that many older patients with diabetes can be treated aggressively with low risk for hypoglycemia. Even if insulin or a sulfonylurea must be part of the regimen, the risk for hypoglycemia may be reduced by assessing the patient’s overall health and social support status thoroughly on a regular basis, providing a strong educational program focused on hypoglycemia recognition and treatment, and considering and perhaps intervening on the risk factors outlined in <span class="s1">Table 99-15</span>.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hyperosmolar Coma and Diabetic Ketoacidosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DKA and hyperosmolar coma are the extreme examples of impaired metabolism in patients with diabetes mellitus. DKA is relatively uncommon in older people, but it can occur in an older patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus. As in younger people, the hallmarks of DKA are substantial</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and volume depletion, and the presence of systemic acidosis caused by marked elevation of ketoacids. Ketoacids result from metabolism of elevated free fatty acids released by lipolysis as a result of severe insulin deficiency. DKA can occur in a patient with type 1 diabetes when insulin is inappropriately discontinued, but in an older adult, DKA may be a result of a major underlying illness that interferes with the patient’s self- care capability. In the setting of severe coexisting major illness in an older individual and decreased tissue perfusion, lactic acidosis may occur in the setting of hyperglycemia. Thus, it is important to document the presence of significant ketonemia to ensure that DKA is contributing to the systemic acidosis observed. Treatment of DKA should focus on immediate insulin replacement to inhibit lipolysis and reverse the ketoacidosis, vigorous replacement of fluids and salt to replace losses, and a thorough evaluation to identify underlying illness. Careful monitoring is required to ensure response and particularly to monitor the cardiovascular system for signs of failure.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Hyperosmolar coma, which occurs primarily in older people, is characterized by marked hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, severe volume depletion, and associated renal insufficiency. The mortality rate is high because there is often a severe underlying illness such as pneumonia or a cerebrovascular accident. Metabolic acidosis is notably absent, or, if present, it is caused by lactic acid rather than ketoacids. The reason for failure to mobilize fatty acids despite severe insulin deficiency in these patients is unclear. While insulin should be provided as part of the initial therapy, the focus should be on volume and sodium replacement and on identification and intervention for major underlying illness. In fact, as volume status is corrected, in the presence of recovering renal function, glucose levels can fall precipitously. Therefore, attention must be paid to avoidance of hypoglycemia.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diabetes in Long-Term Care Facilities</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diabetes mellitus is very common among nursing home residents. Based on national surveys the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in nursing homes is 26% in men and 22% in women. Residents in nursing homes who have diabetes, compared to those without diabetes, tend to have a greater disease burden, are more likely to be frail and have cognitive decline, and have an increased risk for aspiration pneumonia and fecal incontinence. Because of the degree of disability and limited life expectancy of these patients, basic diabetes care</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should usually be the goal, rather than a stringent set of goals for A1C, BP, or lipids. In fact, based on several observational studies, residents in long-term care facilities have better survival if their A1C levels are higher, between 8% and 9%. This goal is consistent with the recommendations for those in poor health listed in <span class="s1">Table 99-6</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">When prescribing medications, particularly hypoglycemic and hypotensive agents, several limitations common among nursing facilities should be considered: non-RN aides (eg, licensed practical nurse or pharmacy technician) usually administer the medications, low staff to resident ratio, and staff may be less trained to understand the risks associated with these agents and have limited ability to recognize and treat hypoglycemia rapidly. The staff may also have limited ability to provide residents’ meals in a timely fashion after administration of rapid-acting insulin. Except for residents who have type 1 diabetes, few nursing home residents with diabetes require frequent insulin injections as tight glucose control is not recommended. However, a simple short-acting insulin regimen may be safer for those patients who require insulin but whose nutrient intake is irregular. For example, short-acting insulin can be given immediately <b>after </b>nutrient ingestion, which allows adjustment for the actual intake.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As undernutrition may be a much more important health problem than obesity for nursing home patients, diet therapy should focus on matching caloric intake to meet nutritional needs rather than restriction of calories. Nursing home residents may lose weight for a variety of reasons, and weight loss in older adults is associated with increased risk of death. Some common causes of weight loss in nursing home residents are depression, swallowing problems, poor dentition, restrictive diet (eg, low-salt, and low-cholesterol diet), and occult infection. Thus, assessment for preventable causes of weight loss should be performed. Furthermore, for a nursing home patient with limited remaining life expectancy, the priority should be to stimulate the patient’s appetite and take advantage of opportunities for the patient to enjoy life, rather than introduction of unnecessary dietary restrictions. Consistency of caloric intake is important for a patient treated with insulin and may be a particular challenge for a disabled nursing home resident. The facility dietician can play a key role by educating facility aides and nurses in appropriate estimates of consumption.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, regular physical activities should be provided for residents in a safely monitored environment. Both aerobic and resistance exercise may</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">improve physical function, decrease injurious falls, decrease depression, improve cognition, and decrease agitated behavior in this setting.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In nursing home patients already at high risk for developing urinary tract infection, diabetes may further increase this risk because of bladder dysfunction secondary to autonomic neuropathy. Particular attention should be paid to keeping the bladder free of infection and carrying out intermittent catheterization as needed. Careful attention to skin and foot care is important to avoid problems with healing and infection.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative and End-of-Life Care</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When an older adult with diabetes is transitioning to palliative care or end- of-life care, the patient and the provider may choose to modify the diabetes treatment goals and intensity of care. Strict glucose, lipid, and blood pressure control may no longer be appropriate, and deprescribing of some drugs may be considered. For example, withdrawal of lipid-lowering therapy may be reasonable. Appropriate diabetes care for patients at the end of life currently lacks quality standards and guidance on best clinical practices. Diabetes UK (formerly British Diabetes Association) commissioned a panel of professional groups and developed recommendations on diabetes care at the end of life. These recommendations are endorsed by the UK National Health Service. The panel recognized that no published evidence justifies specific glucose or hemoglobin A1C targets for end-of-life diabetes care management. The optimal glucose range will vary according to the stage of illness, ability of the patient to eat and drink normally, the presence of hypoglycemia, the nutritional status, and the treatment given. The panel recommended glucose control target ranges between 6 mmol/L (108 mg/dL) to 15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL). Several principal goals for diabetes care of patients at the end of life were recommended as described in <span class="s1">Table 99-16</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 99-16 <span class="s3">■ </span>RECOMMENDED PRINCIPAL GOALS FOR DIABETES CARE OF PATIENTS AT THE END OF LIFE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Based on the prognosis, the panel made detailed recommendations on different approaches to control glucose. Patients with diabetes near the end of life may still require hypoglycemic drugs and monitoring in order to stay comfortable. Severe hyperglycemia such as 350 mg/dL or higher may impair comfort if it leads to thirst, dehydration, infections, urinary incontinence, and falls. A more complicated glucose-lowering regimen that requires more monitoring may be appropriate if the prognosis is several months to a year, whereas minimizing glucose-lowering treatment and monitoring needs would be appropriate if the prognosis is days to weeks. The UK Diabetes recommendations were last updated in November, 2021.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">American Diabetes Association.

The distribution of weakness may provide clues as to broad categorical etiologies: symmetric proximal extremity weakness with a normal neurologic exam suggests a myopathy, whereas distal weakness, distal and proximal weakness, or asymmetric weakness, suggests an underlying neuropathic problem or inclusion body myositis (IBM). Compared with objective muscle weakness, muscle tenderness is a less common finding in most primary myopathies. Muscle tenderness in older people, without demonstrated</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">significant weakness, may be seen with fibromyalgia (chronic widespread pain), regional musculoskeletal disorders (focal findings), and rarely in some patients with PMR (symmetric proximal extremities).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Laboratory Markers</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Routine laboratory measurements of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous) and muscle enzymes (primarily creatine kinase [CK] and aldolase, secondarily AST, ALT, and LDH) are essential components of muscle disease evaluation. Older people have an age-related decrease in CK and aldolase-specific activity per unit DNA in muscle. Despite this fall in mean CK levels with age, the diagnostic accuracy of an elevated CK level in patients older than age 65 with histologically proven myopathy is equal to that in patients younger than age 65 in two retrospective studies.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Electromyography</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Electromyogram (EMG) assessment can identify myopathic changes that help to distinguish myopathy from neuropathic causes of motor weakness such as motor neuron disease, peripheral polyneuropathy, or myasthenia gravis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changes in the voluntary motor unit action potentials (MUAP) and spontaneous muscle electrical activity on EMG can categorize muscle symptoms as arising primarily from either muscle or nerve and provide information on the distribution and severity. If done serially, the progression of myopathic changes can be tracked. MUAP duration best distinguishes between myopathy and neuropathy: total duration increases in neuropathies but decreases in myopathies. Other myopathic findings include MUAPs of small amplitude and polyphasic composition. Increased needle insertional activity (increased in damaged muscles, decreased in muscles replaced by fat or scarring) and spontaneous activity (fibrillation potentials [a degenerating muscle fiber with an unstable membrane fires spontaneously at a regular rate] and positive sharp waves [needle touching damaged, degenerating fibers]) are features of inflammatory myopathy. Older people have a slight tendency toward prolonged MUAP duration and a small increase in the proportion of polyphasic potentials. These changes are due to denervation followed by intramuscular axonal spouting from neighboring axons and reinnervation as described above. This process occurs slowly, and thus the typical features of active degeneration—fibrillations and positive</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sharp waves—are not seen with aging alone. EMG assessment of a cool limb will also produce a higher percentage of increased duration, polyphasic potentials, and reduced spontaneous activity. During EMG testing, this must be considered in older people, who are at increased risk for cool limbs from circulatory insufficiency and reduced insulation (subcutaneous fat). EMG can be used to identify the muscle group that is likely to provide helpful information on biopsy. However, muscle biopsy should not be performed on a muscle that has recently undergone EMG testing.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Imaging of the Skeletal Muscles</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate muscle inflammation, edema with active myositis, fibrosis, and calcification. Unlike muscle biopsy, MRI can assess large areas of muscle (eg, both thighs and both arms), thereby avoiding problems with sampling error. However, MRI is nonspecific and may not distinguish the changes of myositis from those that occur in rhabdomyolysis, muscular dystrophy, or metabolic myopathy. To minimize the sampling error from muscle biopsy and to increase the yield of diagnostic information, MRI can be a noninvasive option to identify the muscle group for biopsy. Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a less expensive and less time-consuming technology than MRI. However, there is not as much experience with ultrasound as MRI, and skeletal muscle ultrasound remains operator-dependent.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Muscle Biopsy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical features—history, exam, laboratories, EMG, and MRI—infrequently provide a diagnosis of a specific muscular disorder. Therefore, muscle biopsy is often necessary to confirm a diagnosis and to provide a basis for therapy. In most clinical circumstances, satisfactory muscle samples for evaluation can be provided by either open or percutaneous techniques.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Complimentary tissue stains are chosen to evaluate general muscle morphology and fiber typing and distribution, and screening tests are chosen to evaluate enzyme deficiencies and storage diseases. Based on autopsy and muscle biopsy studies, muscle biopsy specimens from older people show an increased frequency of type II muscle fiber atrophy, type II fiber-specific decline in muscle satellite cell content, neurogenic changes (including fiber type grouping, angular atrophic fibers, target or “targetoid” fibers), and changes indicating mitochondrial dysfunction (ragged red fibers, and fibers</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">staining negative for cytochrome c oxidase [COX] with concomitant increase in succinate dehydrogenase [SDH] activity). In addition, findings of necrosis, cytoplasmic bodies, ring-fibers, and fibers with increased central nuclei have been noted in muscle specimens from those older than age 70.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinically, the diagnostic accuracy of muscle biopsy findings for inflammatory myopathy in patients aged 65 and older approximates younger adults.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MYOPATHIES IN OLDER PEOPLE</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table 100-1 <span class="p">provides a more specific list of conditions that should be considered in the older patient suspected of having a myopathy.

These conditions share to varying degrees</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">findings of slowly progressive muscle weakness, which is usually symmetric and proximal, elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes, and characteristic changes of an inflammatory myopathy on muscle histopathology. In addition, extramuscular manifestations may include constitutional symptoms, dysphagia, cutaneous features, arthritis, and cardiopulmonary involvement. In 2017, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) developed and validated revised classification criteria for adult IIMs and their significant subgroups. The EULAR/ACR criteria classify patients as having “definite,” “probable,” and “possible” disease based on a score and corresponding probability of disease. This classification approach identifies up to 16 distinct clinical, serologic, and muscle biopsy variables. The broad categories of the IIMs based on their antibody subsets and clinical phenotypes are described in <span class="s1">Table 100-2</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 100-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>ASSOCIATIONS OF MYOSITIS-SPECIFIC AUTOANTIBODIES IN INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dermatomyositis (DM), Polymyositis (PM), Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM), and Anti-Synthetase Syndrome (ASyS)</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with classic <b>dermatomyositis (DM) </b>typically present with symmetric proximal muscle weakness, elevated muscle enzymes, and characteristic cutaneous findings. Patients presenting with weakness and elevated muscle enzymes in the absence of characteristic cutaneous findings of DM present a more complex diagnostic challenge. There are no specific cutaneous findings of other IIMs, and diagnostic serologic tests are less likely to be present. Historically, such patients were diagnosed with PM if the muscle weakness involved proximal muscle groups. With the newer classifications of IMNM and ASyS, and some overlaps with IBM, the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">existence of PM as a distinct entity is being questioned. In an older study, before the EULAR/ACR classification, the estimated annual incidence for the clinically amyopathic subtype of DM was 0.2 per 100,000 persons, with a higher incidence in women.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The cardinal manifestation of DM is a symmetric proximal weakness of subacute onset. In some patients, the cutaneous or pulmonary features could precede the onset of muscle weakness. Several dermatologic features are described in DM: <i>Gottron’s papules </i>(erythematous to violaceous papules that occur symmetrically over bony prominences, particularly the extensor [orsal] aspects of the metacarpophalangeal [MCP] and interphalangeal [IP] joints), <i>Heliotrope eruption </i>(erythematous to violaceous eruption on the periorbital skin, sometimes accompanied by eyelid edema), <i>facial erythema, shawl, Holster</i>, and <i>V-signs </i>(skin that demonstrates both hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, as well as telangiectasias and epidermal atrophy, over the neck, upper chest, upper back, and lateral aspect of the thighs), and <i>nail fold abnormalities </i>(cuticular hypertrophy, periungual erythema, and dilated/dropped out capillary loops). In a subtype of DM called clinically amyopathic DM (CADM), associated with antimelanoma differentiation- associated gene 5 (anti-MDA5) antibody, additional cutaneous features can be seen, namely diffuse hair loss, panniculitis, oral ulcers, and ulcers at the digital pulp/periungual region (30). Interstitial lung disease (ILD) can be present in varying frequencies (20%–80%) in DM and can sometimes precede the onset of myositis. Often, the presenting symptom is dyspnea, which, when present with underlying myositis, could be compounded by myopathy due to the involvement of the diaphragm or respiratory muscles. In evaluating cardiopulmonary symptoms in an older patient with DM, it is essential to utilize studies such as pulmonary function tests with maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure assessments and high-resolution CT scan of the chest. Cardiac manifestations can be present in IIM and may include arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, angina, and fibrosis. Early myocardial involvement can be identified using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging techniques in IIM patients without any overt baseline left ventricular dysfunction by an echocardiogram.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The muscle biopsy specimens from patients with DM show evidence of injury to capillaries and perifascicular myofibers in the forms of myofiber necrosis, perifascicular atrophy, fibrosis, and regeneration in perifascicular regions near areas of connective tissue pathology. The earliest abnormality</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">observed is the deposition of the membrane attack complex around small blood vessels. There may be suggestions of microinfarction mediated by blood vessel dysfunction, evident as abnormal muscle fibers are grouped in one portion of the fascicle. The predominant inflammatory infiltrate is seen in the perimysial and perivascular regions and comprises CD4+ T-cells, B- cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. A pathognomonic feature is the increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I on the muscle fibers (diffuse staining in PM, perifascicular staining in DM)— differentiating these conditions from dystrophies and certain metabolic myopathies causing mononuclear cell infiltrates. Advances in autoantibody detection have identified clinical subgroups of patients with either DM or myositis associated with malignancy. These myositis-specific autoantibodies define more homogeneous populations within the spectrum of the IIM, each with distinct clinical findings and immunogenetic associations (<span class="s1">Table 100-</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2<span class="p">). The syndromes marked by these autoantibodies are more commonly seen in younger adults, with a mean age at diagnosis between 36 and 46, but can be seen in older people.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is a strong association with specific malignancies in patients with DM, including ovarian, lung, pancreatic, stomach, and colorectal cancer.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Approximately 15% of adult DM patients, especially those older than 40 years, have either a preexisting malignancy or will develop a malignancy in the future. In addition, the literature supports an association, based mainly on case-control and cohort studies, of DM with malignancy: up to 15% of patients with DM will have or develop an internal malignancy. Thus, in older people with DM, heightened awareness of the possibility of an underlying malignancy must be maintained. Although an intensive clinical evaluation to exclude an occult malignancy is not without patient risk. In addition, it is not cost-effective for all patients. Therefore, patients should complete gender- specific health care maintenance evaluations and investigations directed to determine the source of any abnormal sign or symptom uncovered through a comprehensive review of systems and physical examination.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Polymyositis (PM) <span class="p">Polymyositis is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM. However, it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. PM is frequently misdiagnosed as it lacks a unique clinical phenotype. Common myopathies that have been misdiagnosed as PM include sIBM, DM, IMNM, overlap syndrome associated with a connective tissue disease (like systemic sclerosis),</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">muscular dystrophies, myalgia syndromes, or toxic and endocrine myopathies. In the future, the term polymyositis could likely become obsolete as there is a refinement of the clinic-sero-pathologic classifications of IIMs.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy <span class="p">IMNM is a group of inflammatory myopathies distinguished from PM in 2004. Most IMNMs are associated with anti-signal recognition particle (anti-SRP) or anti-3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (anti-HMGCR) myositis-specific autoantibodies, although ~20% of patients with IMNM remain seronegative. Anti-SRP-positive IMNM tends to have a rapidly progressive proximal myopathy associated with high CK levels. Patients can frequently have dysphagia, ILD, and myocarditis. The prevalence of anti-HMGCR-positive IMNM ranges from 6% to 10% of IIMs, and anti-HMGCR-positive IMNM occurs more frequently in women older than 40 years. In patients positive for anti-HMGCR antibodies, the target of these autoantibodies is also the target of statins. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that statins may be a trigger of the disease. The percentage of statin exposure in these patients ranges from 15% to 65% depending on their geographic origin and age (90% of patients with anti-HMGCR-positive IMNM and older than 50 years have been exposed to statins). The presence of the MHC class II allele DRB1*11:01 confers a strong immunogenetic predisposition to anti-HMGCR-positive IMNM. Patients with anti-HMGCR-positive IMNMs tend to have proximal muscle involvement mainly in the lower extremities and often precedes upper extremity involvement. They tend not to have extramuscular features.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">On muscle histopathology in patients with IMNM, the characteristic finding is the presence of necrotic muscle fibers. Necrotic myofibers exhibit the characteristics of different stages of necrotic and regenerating myofibres (ie, hyalinized, granular, myophagocytic, lytic, and regenerative). MHC class I on the sarcolemma is usually multifocal, whereas MHC class II is consistently absent from the sarcolemma. The inflammatory infiltrate is often minimal and, when present, tends to be CD 8+ T-cells with macrophages.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Therefore, it is important to obtain a muscle biopsy from a muscle group with mild to moderate weakness. Muscle biopsies in patients who are chronically ill with myopathy will be of a low yield.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The disease course is often prolonged, and the main concerns are residual disability and mortality. In seropositive IMNM, muscle atrophy, residual weakness, and sarcopenia are quite profound due to the severity of the muscle damage. In older people, recovery can be expected to be</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">prolonged as a consequence. Patients with seronegative and anti-HMGCR- positive IMNM must be screened for cancer. Patients with anti-SRP-positive IMNM must be screened for myocarditis, as these conditions have been associated with reduced survival for patients with these subclasses of IMNM.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anti-synthe tase syndrome <span class="p">ASyS is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against one of the aminoacyl-transfer (t)RNA synthetases, commonly anti-Jo1. It is a clinical syndrome including variable expression of myositis, ILD, polyarthritis, mechanic’s hands (roughening and cracking of the skin of the tips and sides of the fingers), Raynaud’s phenomenon, and fever. Both anti-PL7 and anti-PL12 are associated with more prevalent and severe ILD, whereas anti-Jo1 is associated with more intense muscle involvement. Independent of the autoantibody status, Black race is a significant prognostic factor for ILD severity in the United States. The severity of the myopathy tends to be milder compared to other DM subtypes. The anti-Ro-52 antibody can be commonly present with anti-Jo-1 and is associated with an increased tendency to cause arthritis, mechanics hands, and DM-specific skin findings. The 5-year mortality rate reported in different cohorts ranges from 88% to 97%, and the co-existence of ILD increases this risk.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Treatment for IIM remains a challenge, especially in older people. The low prevalence, wide phenotypic heterogeneity, and variable clinical course complicate the assessment of different treatment approaches, hence the absence of standardized therapeutic guidelines. Management needs to be multidisciplinary with experienced clinicians and rehabilitation therapists.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tailored rehabilitation programs under the supervision of a physical therapist are safe in all types of IIMs and are generally recommended to increase strength and reduce disability. There are no current FDA-approved treatments for IIM and few randomized controlled trials to guide treatment. Current treatment approaches are primarily empirical and based on large observational cohorts, case series, and expert opinion. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and co-existent medical conditions are carefully reviewed, systemic glucocorticoid therapy is the initial treatment of choice. However, it is rarely used as monotherapy because of its side effects, such as osteoporosis, hypertension, or weight gain. The route of administration (oral versus intravenous) is based on the acuity and severity of clinical presentation, need for hospitalization, and severity of extramuscular</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">manifestations (for example, certain forms of ILD, arthritis, overlap with another systemic rheumatic disease). Glucocorticoid therapy is started at a high dose and gradually tapered over many weeks to months based on the physician’s clinical judgment. Steroid-sparing therapies are initiated early in treatment to limit the cumulative dose of glucocorticoid, reduce glucocorticoid-related side effects, and maintain remission. These therapies include methotrexate, azathioprine (in patients with normal thiopurine methyltransferase activity), mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, and intravenous immunoglobulin. Special considerations in older people before initiating these therapies include coexistent medical conditions (especially liver or kidney disease to avoid drug toxicities), medication interactions, and certain unique aspects of the disease like ILD (where methotrexate is not preferred). Intravenous immunoglobulin has shown efficacy in DM and IMNM. For refractory forms of IIM, rituximab (a monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes) is preferred over cyclophosphamide due to decreased toxicity and better tolerance.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In recent years, few studies have addressed the differences in clinical manifestations, response to therapy, and prognosis between older and younger adults with IIM. In a comprehensive review of an older cohort, Marie and colleagues retrospectively analyzed 79 consecutive patients with PM-DM presenting to a university’s clinic or hospital over 14 years. It is important to note that this study was conducted many years before identifying the newer IIM variants. Twenty-three (29%) of the patients were 65 years or older (9 men and 14 women, median age 69), 11 with DM, and 12 with PM. In comparing older with younger patients, there were no differences in the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis or in frequencies of myositis diagnoses, Raynaud phenomenon, dysphonia, cardiac impairment, ILD, and peripheral neuropathy. There was a statistically higher frequency (<i>p </i>&lt; 0.05) in the older cohort of esophageal dysfunction (35% vs 16%) and bacterial pneumonia (21% vs 5%), as well as a trend (<i>p </i>= 0.12) toward ventilatory insufficiency. Aspiration from esophageal dysfunction, combined with ventilatory insufficiency, were postulated factors leading to the higher frequency of pneumonia. The diagnostic accuracy of an elevated CK or aldolase, myopathic EMG findings, and characteristic inflammatory changes on muscle biopsy were similar to that in younger patients. However, older patients had a statistically higher frequency of elevated acute phase reactants</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and lower hemoglobin levels, total protein, and albumin. These latter findings may be owing to concurrent malignancy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The response to therapy and outcome of older patients with PM-DM is poorer than in younger adults. Despite a similar distribution of most therapeutic modalities (steroids, azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin, methotrexate) between younger and older adults in the study of Marie, only 13.6% of older patients achieved complete remission of PM-DM versus 41% of younger patients. This trend is supported in previous reports. The age-specific mortality rate is also higher in older patients with PM-DM. Older age is but one of many described poor prognostic factors in PM-DM, including malignancy, gender, disease severity, ILD, dysphagia, bacterial pneumonia, delays in initiating therapy, and resistance to complications from therapy. It is therefore not surprising that older patients reported by Marie, who overall had a higher frequency of malignancy, dysphagia, bacterial pneumonia, and inability to induce remission with therapy versus younger patients, had a higher mortality rate as well: 48% versus 7%. Malignancies were directly responsible for six of the 11 deaths (54%) in older patients and bacterial pneumonia for four (36%). As the development of aspiration and ventilatory insufficiency is associated with bacterial pneumonia, an early assessment of esophageal and lung involvement in patients presenting with PM-DM can detect subclinical muscle involvement and early intervention, which may reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sporadic IBM and the hereditary inclusion body myopathie s <span class="p">The term IBM was first used in 1971 to describe patients with IIM whose muscle biopsies displayed degenerating muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles and unique, tubulofilamentous nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions. Patients with IBM are now separated into two distinct sets based on patterns of inheritance, clinical findings, muscle biopsy changes at the light- and electron-microscopic levels, and immunoreactivities demonstrated in the filaments: sporadic IBM (s-IBM) and the hereditary inclusion body myopathies (h-IBM). These two patient subsets share similar features on muscle biopsy. However, unlike in</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">s-IBM, there is an absence of inflammatory change in muscle biopsy specimens from patients with h-IBM, hence the term inclusion body “myopathy,” not “myositis.”</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">S-IBM is the most common inflammatory myopathy in patients older than age 50, with a reported median age of 65 years at the time of diagnosis. The prevalence estimates range from five to seven cases per million, with more</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">recent reports of up to 70 per million from Scandinavia. Older age of onset has been associated with a faster progression of weakness. As contrasted against PM and DM, s-IBM affects men two to three times more frequently than women and is more common in Caucasians than other races. The course of painless, proximal muscle weakness and atrophy develops insidiously, commonly over the years, often leading to a delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis. Unlike PM and DM, distal limb muscle involvement is seen in 50%, occurs early, and may predominate in up to one- third of patients. Quadriceps weakness, an early manifestation, is manifested as difficulty in climbing up or (more frequently) down a flight of stairs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eventually, with progressing muscle weakness, getting out of a chair is difficult. Quadriceps weakness and knee giving-way may lead to an increased frequency of falling. The fall risk may be accentuated by co- existent medical conditions and polypharmacy in older adults. The tibialis anterior is frequently involved, leading to asymmetric and subtle foot drop further contributing to falls. In the clinic, “hopping on one leg” or “heel walk” can identify the early weakness of the tibialis anterior. A characteristic pattern of (often asymmetric) finger and wrist flexor, knee extensor, and ankle dorsiflexor weakness have been described. It may be specific enough to diagnose even when rimmed vacuoles and other characteristic histologic muscle biopsy findings are absent. Although interosseous muscles of the hand are generally spared, characteristic involvement of the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor pollicis longus impairs the ability to oppose the thumb and index finger and perform fine motor movements, leading to significant disability. The prominent involvement of the quadriceps muscles may be severe enough in some patients that patellar reflexes are diminished, simulating an underlying neuropathy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Rarely, cricopharyngeal involvement may lead to dysphagia and can precede limb weakness by years. The risk of aspiration is the highest in this group. Muscle enzymes are normal in approximately 20% and elevated no more than 12 times normal in most patients. A recently described autoantibody against cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) has been recognized in patients with s-IBM. While not a diagnostic test, early studies have described good sensitivity (72%) and high specificity (92%). EMG findings are atypical in 30%, including the absence of inflammatory changes or the presence of a prominent neuropathic component. A small percentage of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">patients may have an associated autoimmune, infectious (most commonly viral), or another systemic inflammatory disease. There are at least 12 published criteria sets for s-IBM, which encompass at least 24 diagnostic categories. Categories include age threshold, symptom duration and progression, strength assessment, CK level, EMG findings, and histologic and immunoreactivity assessments on muscle pathology. A data-driven assessment of these patient variables demonstrated that the combination of</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1) finger flexion or quadriceps weakness, (2) endomysial inflammation on biopsy, and (3) either invasion of nonnecrotic muscle fibers or rimmed vacuoles had 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity as diagnostic criteria.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of s-IBM are not well understood. It should no longer be considered a myodegenerative disorder solely, and often cited reports of intramuscular accumulation of β-amyloid and tau proteins have been refuted. Current evidence suggests a more complicated pathophysiologic process that involves a genetic contribution (strong association with the HLADRB1 and the MHC8.1 haplotypes), immunologic activity (autoantibody to cN1A, T and B cells surrounding and displacing myofibers, B cell maturation, and differentiation within muscle in the absence follicles, active myeloid dendritic cells), and other abnormalities of unclear relationship to the immune system (nuclear degeneration, sarcoplasmic accumulation of normally nuclear nucleic acid- binding proteins, and loss of fast-twitch sarcomeric proteins).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Rehabilitation strategies, more so than medical treatments, play critical roles in disease management. A physical therapy program of strength training should be prescribed for all patients with s-IBM and will not elevate serum CK levels. The presence of foot drop or knee instability requires splinting or bracing, respectively, to prevent contractures and aid in ambulation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dysphagia should prompt evaluation to assess the need for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), esophageal dilation, botulinum toxin injections, or cricopharyngeal myotomy. Standard medical therapy for IIM— corticosteroids with or without immunosuppressive agents—does not stop disease progression. Immunosuppressive therapy in IBM has been helpful in IBM only in specific subgroups, such as those with rapid progression and creatine phosphokinase &gt; 15 × upper limit of normal, or overlap with other autoimmune conditions. The use of steroids is associated with accelerated atrophy of type II fibers in IBM. This lack of improvement with medical therapy has been described as a clinical hallmark of the disease.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Furthermore, corticosteroids decrease CK levels if even the underlying pathophysiology is not autoimmune, and CK level changes do not always correlate with changes in strength. A recent study demonstrated that those treated with immunosuppressive medication developed difficulty walking faster than untreated patients.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Endocrine/Metabolic Diseases</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thyroid disease <span class="p">Thyroid disease is prevalent in the older population. Hypothyroidism is more prevalent than hyperthyroidism (approximately 7% vs 2%, respectively), both conditions are more common in women than men, and either condition can lead to myopathic symptoms.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis of hypothyroidism in older people can be difficult, as they present with fewer signs and symptoms and a diminished frequency of the classical signs of chilliness, paresthesias, weight gain, and cramps compared to younger patients. The prevalence of neuromuscular symptoms in patients with hypothyroidism is reported to be high (up to 80%) and includes weakness, muscle fatigue, and muscle cramps. Weakness is a common sign and symptom in older people with hypothyroidism, occurring in 53% of patients older than age 70 in one prospective study. Myopathic symptoms may rarely be the sole presenting feature of hypothyroidism. The spectrum of muscle involvement in hypothyroidism is broad. Symptomatic patients may present with myalgias without CK elevation, muscle hypertrophy with stiffness, weakness, and cramps, a myopathy that may simulate polymyositis with CK elevation. Pain and stiffness, when predominant, may suggest PMR or fibromyalgia. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in hypothyroidism and is associated with muscle weakness; myalgia markedly elevated CK, and myoglobinuria. In hypothyroid myopathy without rhabdomyolysis, serum CK can vary from normal to markedly elevated. A delay in muscle relaxation after handgrip or muscle percussion—pseudomyotonia—may be seen. The severity of the myopathy parallels the degree and duration of the hormone deficiency. CK levels are usually elevated, and electromyography may either be normal or show myopathic features. Muscle biopsy may be normal, may show focal necrosis and mild inflammatory infiltrates, or demonstrate nonspecific morphologic changes, including fiber size variation, type I fiber predominance, and type II fiber atrophy. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy leads to rapid improvement of myopathic signs and symptoms, with complete recovery over several weeks or months. However, weakness may</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">take longer to improve than chemical and EMG abnormalities. Most patients have recovered by 6 months, but up to 10% have weakness on examination 1 year after initiation of treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Hyperthyroidism may also cause proximal myopathy. The reported prevalence of hyperthyroidism in older people is up to 4%, but those over 60 accounts for 10% to 17% of all hyperthyroid patients and 35% of all patients with thyrotoxicosis. Like patients with hypothyroidism, one prospective cohort study of hyperthyroid patients older than age 70 demonstrated a paucity of clinical signs compared with a younger adult population, emphasizing the difficulty of making a diagnosis. Clinically, the proximal myopathy of hyperthyroidism develops insidiously and progresses slowly but may lead to marked weakness. Rarely, an acutely progressive form of muscle weakness is described. Weakness is not uncommonly greater than the degree of muscle atrophy. Paradoxically, serum CK levels are usually normal or minimally elevated. EMG and muscle biopsy features may show a myopathic process. As with hypothyroid patients, therapy is directed at correcting the underlying thyroid dysfunction.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Osteomalacia <span class="p">Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease of the under mineralized collagen matrix in which an unmineralized matrix (osteoid) accumulates at bone surfaces. This disease most often affects older people whose most common etiology is vitamin D deficiency, superimposed on the age-related decrease in muscle vitamin D receptor number and function. In this way, the presentation may mimic that of osteoporosis. Nonspecific bone pain and tenderness with or without fractures are the dominant symptoms, but muscle weakness is not uncommon. Patients with severe weakness may mimic the presentation of PM. The myopathy is characteristically proximal in distribution, and the lower limbs may produce a waddling gait. CK levels are typically normal, and a myopathic pattern may be seen on EMG. Minimal inflammatory infiltrates may be found with other myopathic features on muscle biopsy. Myopathy usually responds to vitamin D administration, with or without supplemental calcium or phosphate, depending on the etiology of osteomalacia.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amyloid Myopathy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Muscle involvement in patients with amyloidosis is a common finding in this rare disorder. Typical manifestations in skeletal muscle include pseudohypertrophy, palpable nodular masses within the muscle, and a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“wooden consistency” firmness of muscles. These abnormalities may be severe enough to lead to weakness, pain, and immobility. Amyloid myopathy may present without these more typical features but rather with progressive proximal muscle weakness and dysphagia, elevated serum CK levels, and EMG changes of inflammatory myopathy. In addition, muscle biopsies may reveal extracellular amyloid deposits around muscle fibers and some small vessels. This proximal myopathy from amyloid is rare but should be considered in the older patient with a proximal myopathy without pseudohypertrophy.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drug-Induced Myopathies</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the exact percentage is unknown, the prevalence of drug-induced myopathy in older people is not trivial. Older people are at risk for drug- induced myopathies. The medications commonly causing myopathic symptoms are given for diseases that themselves have an increased incidence with age. Such drugs usually require a cofactor (eg, renal or hepatic insufficiency), some of which are age-related. A drug-induced myopathy may present as a necrotizing myopathy (eg, autoimmune necrotizing myopathy from statins), inflammatory myopathy (eg, procainamide), mitochondrial myopathy, antimicrotubular myopathy (eg, colchicine), lysosomal storage myopathy (eg, amiodarone), myofibrillar myopathy, or as type II muscle fiber atrophy (eg, corticosteroids). The scope of this chapter does not allow for an in-depth discussion of all possible toxic myopathies, but the awareness of this important category is essential. The reader is referred to recent reviews. Summary comments below are limited to selected drugs with risk for toxic myopathy in older people.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corticoste roids <span class="p">Myopathy is a well-known side effect of corticosteroids. Myopathy is generally seen with larger doses, longer duration, and more frequent dosing. The likelihood is also higher with the use of fluorinated steroids. The dichotomy exists when treating older patients with IIM, PMR, giant cell arteritis (GCA), or another systemic rheumatic disease that needs a prolonged duration of treatment with systemic steroids. The benefits of such prolonged steroid therapy should be weighed against the risk of causing steroid-induced myopathy. Proximal hip girdle muscles are mainly affected, but shoulder girdle and diffuse muscle involvement may be seen. Respiratory muscles can be affected, even when limb muscles remain strong. Typical findings include normal serum CK levels, a myopathic EMG without</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">inflammatory changes, and muscle biopsy findings of excessive type II (IIb) muscle fiber atrophy or normal changes for age. Steroids induce a decrease in muscle protein synthesis and an increase in protein degradation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antianabolic effects include inhibition of amino acid transport into muscle, inhibition of the ability of insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and certain amino acids to stimulate the initiation of mRNA translation, and downregulation of myogenin and the degradation of MyoD, transcription factors required for differentiation of satellite cells into muscle fibers.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Catabolic effects of steroids are mediated by stimulating proteolysis of muscle contractile proteins through ubiquitin-proteasome, lysosomal (cathepsins), and calcium-dependent (calpains) systems. Muscle wasting leads to increased urinary creatine excretion, detected as an increase in % creatinuria; urine creatine divided by the sum of urine creatine plus creatinine in a 24-hour specimen should be less than 6%, but is elevated in a steroid myopathy. This test is useful when trying to distinguish steroid myopathy from myalgias without myopathy in a normal CK level setting.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Therapy for steroid myopathy involves steroid taper and reconditioning exercises, with exercise additionally beneficial for reducing glucocorticoid receptors in muscle.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Alcohol </span>Older people are not immune to alcohol-related health problems. See <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 23 </span>for details of aging and alcohol use. Alcoholic myopathy may present in three forms. First, a subclinical form is manifested solely by the elevation of muscle enzymes that return to normal during abstinence. Second, acute alcoholic myopathy is associated with acute intoxication. There may be a profound weakness, myalgias, and rhabdomyolysis, with marked elevation of CK and myoglobinuria. Findings of an inflammatory myopathy are seen on EMG, and biopsy shows necrosis with varying degrees of inflammation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is also a high risk of falls with acute intoxication that may cause rhabdomyolysis or a fracture. With conservative care, the CK may rapidly drop over days to a week. This observation is essential to keep in mind so that the patient may be kept from the inappropriate early use of corticosteroids. Third, the syndrome may mimic severe polymyositis at the onset. Finally, alcohol more commonly causes a chronic proximal myopathy. Chronic alcohol use may lead to muscle atrophy, more in the legs than arms, with evaluation showing normal CK levels, noninflammatory myopathic EMG, and type II fiber atrophy on muscle biopsy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Colchicine <span class="p">Colchicine is used to manage acute gouty arthritis and less often for chronic management of chronic calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. It is an uncommon cause of drug-induced myopathy. Colchicine can cause toxicity by preventing the extension of myotubules in the myocyte due to the binding of the drug to tubulin dimers. Patients present with proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK, and a nonspecific vacuolar myopathy on biopsy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Renal insufficiency is a major risk factor, making even low daily prophylactic doses (eg, in the treatment of gout) in this situation prone to causing neuromyotoxicity. Therefore, colchicine dose should always be adjusted for the degree of renal function.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lipid-lowe ring agents <span class="p">All lipid-lowering agents, except for bile acid sequestrants (resins) and plant sterols, may cause myalgias or myopathy. Nicotinic acid, uncommonly, may cause myalgias and elevated CK levels. Ezetimibe (an inhibitor of the intestinal intraluminal sterol transporter) has been documented in case reports to cause tendinopathy and myopathy, either alone or when given with statins. Fibric acid derivatives can cause muscle cramps, acute or painful subacute myopathy, and elevated CK levels with or without signs of myoglobinuria. Myopathy from fibrates is more likely to occur in a patient with renal insufficiency. Among the lipid-lowering therapies, fibrates appear to have a higher relative risk for myopathy than do statins.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Statin drugs have been associated with myalgias (cramping, aching or stiffness, transient or persistent, with normal CK level) in 5% to 10%, myositis (elevated CK) in approximately 1%, and rhabdomyolysis in approximately 0.1% of treated patients. Statins have also been reported to cause tendon-associated pain, and it is estimated that up to 25% of statin users may develop exercise-induced muscle pain, cramping, or fatigue. Older people are at higher risk for the development of statin-induced myopathy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other risk factors include patient characteristics (female sex, renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, hypothyroidism, biliary tract obstruction, underlying muscle disease, grapefruit juice intake) and properties of the statin (higher dose, lipophilicity, and potential for drug-drug interactions with other medications metabolized by cytochrome P450 [especially CYP3A4] pathways, eg, amiodarone, fibrates, cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors and numerous antibiotics including erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampin). The median duration of statin therapy before symptom onset is 6 months but maybe as long as 4 years. The myopathy is self-limited, with a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">median duration of myalgias and resolution of CK elevation following cessation of statin therapy of 2 to 3 months. Persistent symptoms and/or elevated CK level despite statin discontinuation may indicate an underlying other myopathy or the development of a statin-induced necrotizing myopathy. There is no agreed-upon case definition for statin-induced myopathy, contributing to the inconsistent recommendations from national organizations (ACC/AHA/NHLBI, FDA, National Lipid Association) to screen for statin- related toxicity management symptoms. There is agreement that the statin be discontinued if the CK is more than 10-fold the upper limit of normal but differing recommendations as to when to measure CK (at baseline +/− at regular follow-up intervals, or just with symptoms) and how to manage statin therapy at lower levels of CK elevation. Treatment strategies include reducing the statin dose, changing to nondaily statin dosing, changing to a statin metabolized by a route other than by the CYP3A4 pathway, changing to a nonstatin lipid-lowering agent, and adding supplemental coenzyme Q10.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The precise mechanisms of statin-induced myopathy are incompletely understood. However, they may include induction of apoptosis, induction of atrogin-1 (a ubiquitin ligase active in proteolysis), instability of myocyte membranes from decreased cholesterol content, depletion of isoprenoids (isoprenylation being responsible for the posttranslational modification of up to 2% of cellular proteins) or coenzyme Q10, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased hepatic uptake of statins in individuals heterozygous (odds ratio for myopathy of 4.4) or homozygous (odds ratio 17.4) for the C-allele variant of the <i>SLCO1B1 </i>gene.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As mentioned above, persistent myopathic symptoms and/or hyperCKemia following discontinuation of statin therapy may indicate the development of a medication-triggered immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy. Statins not only inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) but lead to a compensatory increase in HMGCR levels. Detection of an autoantibody (anti-200/100) against HMGCR is found in those patients with a progressive myopathy despite discontinuation of statin therapy. However, this antibody may also be detected in patients without prior statin exposure who presumably have sustained muscle damage (eg, from a toxin or infectious agent), leading to increased HMGCR expression from regenerating muscle cells. In statin-exposed patients, this autoimmune myopathy shows no gender bias, but the risk for developing anti-HMGCR antibodies is strongly</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">associated with the HLA-DRβ1<span class="s22">*</span>11:01 gene allele. Several statins have been</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">associated with this syndrome. Before the onset of myopathy, the duration of statin therapy could range from 31 months to as long as 7 years. Muscle biopsy shows a necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation, similar to that seen in patients with anti-SRP antibodies. In contrast to those with no prior statin exposure, statin-exposed patients with this immune- mediated necrotizing myopathy respond to immunosuppressant therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, aggressive therapy may be required, and the course of treatment may be prolonged.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The past decade has seen the emergence of a revolutionary approach to cancer therapy using checkpoint inhibitors, called immunotherapy. These are immunomodulatory antibodies used to enhance the immune system and have substantially improved the prognosis for patients with advanced malignancy. Multiple antibodies against programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are in development and have shown great promise in multiple malignancies. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, and dostarlimab, all of which target PD-1, and atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab, all of which target PD-L1, have been approved in various indications (for example, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non– small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, urothelial carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and endometrial cancer). Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, is approved for use in patients with advanced melanoma based on a significant improvement in overall survival. However, with their increasing use, there are a growing number of reports on immune- related adverse events from immunotherapies. Immune-mediated neuromuscular side effects of checkpoint inhibitors greatly vary in presentation and differ from IIM. These side effects can be life-threatening and may result in permanent sequelae. In a multicenter cancer registry, myositis was the most frequent neuromuscular adverse event. In 32% of cases, myositis was complicated by concomitant myocarditis. Furthermore, cases of isolated myocarditis, myasthenia gravis, PMR, neuro-radiculopathy, and asymptomatic CK elevation were reported.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hydroxychloroquine</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial medication with immunomodulatory properties. It is a mainstay of the medication regimen in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">systemic lupus erythematosus. It is also used in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritides, IIMs with cutaneous manifestations, and Sjogren’s disease with joint involvement. The long-term use of HCQ can be associated with muscle toxicity, mainly described as a proximal myopathy with evidence of lysosomal dysfunction on muscle biopsy. Symptom onset has been reported anywhere from 6 months to 21 years of using HCQ. In a single-center study, the median age of presentation was 66 years. The clinical presentation could include proximal limb muscle weakness, dysphagia, axial weakness, heart failure due to myocardial involvement, and, rarely, respiratory failure. On electrocardiogram, QT interval prolongation can be seen in patients with cardiac involvement.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, the diagnosis is often delayed as it is a rare association. Muscle histopathology shows a myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and marked acid phosphatase reactivity and curvilinear bodies on electron microscopy. The mainstay of treatment is to stop HCQ, which can result in variable improvement in muscle weakness.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late-Onset Muscular Dystrophies</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Muscular dystrophies are genetically determined degenerative myopathies that usually present before adulthood. These diverse groups of inherited muscle protein disorders are characterized by their patterns of inheritance and penetrance, age of onset, progression, severity, and muscles involved. Weakness proceeds slowly, and the arrest of progression has been described. Depending on the particular disease, some patients may proceed into older adulthood with minimal or undetectable symptoms before the cumulative effects of muscle degeneration lead to functional decline. Three late-onset muscular dystrophies are described, each causing proximal limb weakness: facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, oculopharyngeal dystrophy, and late-onset limb-girdle dystrophy. These dystrophies are associated with normal or mild elevations of serum CK and a nonspecific myopathic pattern on EMG. Muscle biopsy findings are nondiagnostic and can show loss of muscle fibers, variation in fiber size, and degrees of muscle fiber necrosis. Therapy is limited to patient and family education, palliative measures to prevent aspiration, and empiric physical therapy.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy <span class="p">is an autosomal dominant disease that typically begins with facial muscle weakness (eg, inability to tightly close eyes or whistle), sparing the extraocular and pharyngeal muscles. Weakness</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tends to proceed caudally, involving muscles of the shoulder (scapular winging) then pelvic girdles, although early tibialis anterior involvement is characteristic. Extramuscular features include sensorineural hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. Diagnosis can be made by molecular genetic testing of blood.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Oculopharyngeal dystrophy <span class="p">is also inherited through an autosomal dominant pattern with complete penetrance and is the only dystrophy that presents more commonly in older people. It is classified as a polyalanine disorder, with the mutation in poly (A) binding protein 1 (PABPN1).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Symptoms begin in the fifth or sixth decade of life. Proximal upper and lower extremity weakness is a late finding, following the onset of symptoms with ptosis (bilateral, but can be asymmetric) and dysphagia. Supportive care includes surgery to correct ptosis and cricopharyngeal myotomy for severe dysphagia. The pathologic hallmark is unique, filamentous intranuclear inclusions that have been shown to contain aggregations of mutated PABPN1. Diagnosis is made through molecular genetic testing.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Limb-girdle dystrophy <span class="p">represents disorders with heterogeneous phenotypes but with predominant scapular and pelvic girdle involvement (legs earlier and more severely than the arms). The presence of dysrhythmia or contractures suggests laminopathy. Mutations in at least 19 genes have been described, encoding proteins for calpain 3, caveolin, dysferlin, lamin, sarcoglycans, and telethonin. Autosomal dominant (with incomplete penetrance) and recessive inheritance patterns are observed; thus, the clinical phenotype does not accurately predict the genotype. A specific diagnosis is based on the combination of results from DNA mutation testing and muscle protein analysis.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late-Onset Mitochondrial Myopathy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ragged red fibers are the histologic hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and represent the result of a diverse set of conditions, including normal aging, sporadic IBM and other neuromuscular diseases, and myopathies from drugs that cause mitochondrial damage. The mitochondrial myopathies/encephalomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders displaying specific clinical manifestations, maternal inheritance, excessive ragged red fibers on muscle biopsy, the altered energy state of resting muscle, mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and deficiencies in the activities of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes. Most patients present</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">symptomatically within the first three decades of life. A syndrome of late- onset mitochondrial myopathy has been described. Patients have progressive proximal muscle weakness of insidious onset and limb muscle fatigability, mainly in the lower limbs. Serum levels of CK are mildly elevated, and myopathic changes can be seen on EMG. Excessive ragged red fibers are noted on muscle biopsy. This condition represents an exaggerated form of the accumulation of mtDNA mutations that occurs with aging, which manifests clinically as a proximal myopathy.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paraspinal Myopathies of Older People</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Severe weakness isolated to paraspinal muscles is uncommon and usually a manifestation of another underlying neurologic disease, muscular dystrophy, or myopathy. Weakness is evident when in the erect position, and the postural abnormality resolves when supine or with passive extension. Conditions reported to be associated with this finding include inflammatory and noninflammatory myopathies (including polymyositis, IBM, and certain endocrine/metabolic myopathies), facioscapulohumeral and limb-girdle dystrophies, neurologic diseases of the motor neuron (ALS, postpolio syndrome), and peripheral nerves (chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy), Parkinson disease, and as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Involvement of the cervical spine is termed dropped head syndrome, while the phenotype of thoracolumbar spinal weakness is referred to as bent spine syndrome.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although kyphosis is a frequent finding in older people, it is usually limited to the thoracic spine and rarely involves the lumbar spine. Bent spine syndrome, or camptocormia (from the Greek for active forward trunk bending), is the consequence of chronically progressive lumbar and thoracic kyphosis in the absence of an architectural abnormality of the vertebral column to account for the postural change. The majority of cases of muscular origin are due to idiopathic, late-onset, axial myopathy. Those affected are predominately older women, and a positive family history of similar symptoms is reported in up to three-fourth of patients. CK levels are normal or mildly elevated. EMG testing can reveal myopathic and/or neuropathic changes in paravertebral muscles and mild myopathic changes (some with inflammatory infiltrates) with a marked increase in connective tissue and fatty infiltration is seen in muscle biopsy specimens from affected patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radiographic, computerized tomographic, and magnetic resonance scanning analyses show diffuse muscle atrophy limited to the spinal muscles, without</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evidence of significant bony changes, in a pattern of muscle involvement distinct from that caused by spinal stenosis. Treatment for this primary axial myopathy is mainly supportive, including exercise therapy, orthoses, and assistive devices for ambulation. Patients with secondary forms or with myositis on biopsy may respond to corticosteroids.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A more limited form of spinal weakness of the neck extensors causes dropped head syndrome. Weakness leads to the inability to keep the head from dropping on the chest. CK is usually normal but may be elevated, and EMG testing of affected muscles shows myopathic changes. Muscle biopsy may reveal inflammatory infiltrates as well as nonspecific mild myopathic abnormalities. Dropped head syndrome from isolated myositis may respond to steroid therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA AND GIANT CELL ARTERITIS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PMR and GCA are discussed together as they share similar epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment findings. Each is a systemic inflammatory disease that probably forms the ends of a spectrum of illnesses. Thus, individual patients may be affected by one disease or both conditions simultaneously. The reported frequency of GCA occurring in patients with PMR ranges from 0% to 80% and varies according to how aggressively an approach to temporal artery biopsy is undertaken. A more realistic estimate is that GCA occurs in 15% to 20% of PMR patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Conversely, PMR occurs in 40% to 60% of patients with GCA and is the presenting symptom in 25%. Thus, the incidence of PMR is higher than that of GCA, and prevalence estimates are at least three times higher. Apart from the approach taken as to the clinical timing and size of temporal artery biopsy, differences in these prevalence data likely reflect selection bias of the populations studied and the use of different diagnostic criteria.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Polymyalgia Rheumatica</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PMR is a clinical syndrome of the neck and limb-girdle aching of older adults. Patients have laboratory evidence of systemic inflammatory response, an excellent response to low-dose corticosteroids and no evidence to support other causes of a systemic illness such as malignancy or another connective tissue disease.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology and pathoge nesis <span class="p">PMR is seen in patients aged 50 and older, and 90% of cases occur in those older than 60. The female-to-male ratio is 2:1, and Caucasians are the most commonly affected subgroup. The condition is especially prevalent among those from northern European ancestry. The incidence rate is 50 cases per 100,000 persons over the age of 50 per year, rises with increasing age, and is two- to threefold higher than the rate for GCA. The corresponding prevalence rate for PMR is 600 per 100,000.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lifetime risk is 2.4% for women and 1.7% for men.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The etiology of PMR is unknown, and the source of pain symptoms is not clearly defined. Evidence from studies of the shoulder, hip, and surrounding tissues using radioisotopes, ultrasound, and fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement has demonstrated combinations of nonerosive synovitis at the phenotypic level, bursitis, tenosynovitis, and muscle edema in patients with active PMR. On musculoskeletal ultrasound, subdeltoid bursitis, biceps tenosynovitis, and/or glenohumeral/hip synovitis are characteristic findings in PMR. The diffuse distribution of these findings—particularly the presence of abnormalities outside synovial compartments—may explain the generalized pain felt by patients and reflects a pattern of inflammatory changes distinct from that seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Microscopically, arthroscopic biopsy studies have documented the presence of synovitis. In the synovial lesion, vascular proliferation is accompanied by an inflammatory infiltrate composed primarily of macrophages, CD4+ T-cells, and scarce neutrophils. A relative absence of B-cells and γδ T-cells differentiate the synovitis of PMR from that seen in rheumatoid arthritis. The cellular milieu parallels that seen in the temporal arteries of patients with GCA (see further). This finding and the presence of GCA histology and proinflammatory cytokines without typical histologic changes in temporal artery biopsy specimens of PMR patients without GCA symptoms further strengthen the association between the two diseases. There is a reported association of PMR at the genetic level with the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">markers HLA-DRB1<span class="s22">*</span>0401 and HLA-DRB1<span class="s22">*</span>0404. Cases occurring in family members support a possible genetic component to the disease. However, the event that triggers disease in the setting of potential genetic risk is unknown. Seasonal outbreaks of cases have suggested an infectious etiology, but no specific, causal pathogen has been identified to date. PMR, unlike certain IIM, is not associated with malignancy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical feature s and diagnostic criteria <span class="p">An abrupt onset or slowly progressive, symmetric pain (of at least 1 month) and stiffness develop in the neck and proximal limb-girdle areas. Symptoms may be difficult to localize and can be severe enough to limit activity analogous to proximal myopathy or impingement syndrome. Shoulder pain (75%–90%) is more common than hip pain (50%–70%). Constitutional symptoms include fever, malaise, night sweats, and weight loss in a third of patients, but high fever is uncommon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other associated symptoms include prolonged morning stiffness upon awakening of affected areas, daytime gelling with inactivity, and arthralgias. Symptoms of GCA (see below) are noted in 15% to 20% of patients. A thorough history, including an extensive review of systems, and general physical examination, is essential to exclude conditions that may present with similar complaints, including sources of myopathy (see section Myopathies in Older People), occult malignancy, other connective tissue diseases, chronic infections, and spinal and regional musculoskeletal disorders.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Physical examination is usually unrevealing. Palpable muscular tenderness, when present, is not dramatic. Shoulder and hip motion may be limited by pain, but true weakness is usually not present. A mild, symmetric, nonerosive polyarthritis of the hands, wrists, and knees may be seen in a third of patients and be difficult to distinguish from the presentation of late- onset rheumatoid arthritis, especially when symptoms are confined to the large joints. Synovitis of the glenohumeral joint and tenosynovitis of the long head of the biceps tendon can be present in more than half of patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Synovitis of small foot joints is less common than in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Steroid-responsive, dorsal hand pitting edema occurs with hand and wrist synovitis, similar to that seen in RS3PE (remitting seronegative symmetric synovitis with pitting edema) syndrome is seen in up to 8%.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">An elevated acute-phase reactant is present in at least 80% to 90% of cases at presentation. The Westergren ESR is greater than 40 mm/h and not uncommonly as high as 100 mm/h. C-reactive protein is also elevated, but no specific cutoff is universally used to support the clinical diagnosis. In addition, test results are occasionally discordant because one test may perform better in certain persons than others. Using the height of serum IL-6 level elevation as a marker for adjusting initial corticosteroid therapy and monitoring response to treatment has been investigated but is not a standard of care.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, some have suggested that the height of ESR at presentation correlates with severity and prognosis. Normochromic, normocytic anemia during active disease may be seen in two-thirds of patients, and abnormal liver function tests in up to a third. Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody testing are negative. To evaluate late-onset rheumatoid arthritis, it is important to obtain rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated protein levels. CK levels are normal, but EMG testing on rare occasions may show changes of inflammatory myopathy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">PMR is a clinical diagnosis based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings, as no single manifestation is pathognomonic for the disease. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) have proposed provisional classification criteria for PMR (<span class="s1">Table 100-3</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 100-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>PROVISIONAL CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment <span class="p">The mainstay therapy for PMR is systemic glucocorticoids. Additional treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be considered</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">individually, as suggested in the 2015 EULAR/ACR recommendations for PMR management. The minimum effective dose from a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily should be used. Patients at high risk for relapse or prolonged therapy should receive the higher dose; those at lower risk should receive the lower dose. Clinical improvement should be noted after 2 weeks, with a nearly complete response at 4 weeks. For initial glucocorticoid tapering, the oral dose should be gradually reduced to 10 mg prednisone equivalent daily within 4 to 8 weeks; during therapy for relapse, the dose should be decreased gradually (within 4–8 weeks) after the relapse occurs. Once remission is achieved (after initial and relapse therapies), oral prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or similar, eg, 2.5 mg every 10 weeks) until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lack of initial response should prompt an evaluation for an alternate diagnosis. Despite rapid clinical improvement, further tapering of the dose is done slowly in order to prevent relapse. Once the ESR normalizes and symptoms resolve, but usually after 4 to 8 weeks, the dose is reduced in small decrements: by 2.5 mg every 2 to 4 weeks until 10 mg QD is reached, then by 1 mg every 4 weeks. The lowest dose that controls symptoms should always be used. If exacerbations occur during the taper (approximately 25% of patients), the dose can be increased (although not necessarily to the starting level), and the tapering recommenced. Patient symptoms rather than the ESR level alone are the main parameter to follow. Alternate-day dosing of steroids is less effective than a daily schedule.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A course of steroids under these guidelines may take a minimum of 12 to 18 months to complete. Three-quarters of patients are off steroid therapy by 2 years. Persistent elevation of the ESR, rise of the ESR after initial fall and symptom improvement during therapy, or failure to improve with low-dose corticosteroids, may indicate the presence of GCA and the consideration for temporal artery biopsy or an alternate diagnosis. Patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of GCA at every visit, and if present, referred for temporal artery biopsy even while on corticosteroid therapy. All patients receiving corticosteroids should be started on measures to prevent osteoporosis and be closely monitored for other metabolic side effects. A percentage of patients, ranging from 10% to 30% depending on the reported series, may require longer corticosteroid courses or chronic daily doses (eg, prednisone at 5 mg or less per day) to maintain symptom control. The benefits of such prolonged therapy should be weighed against the serious risk</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of steroid-induced side effects in older people. Conclusive clinical trials do not well support alternative therapies.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Methotrexate is the only immunosuppressive agent that has proved efficacious for PMR in randomized controlled trials and should be considered early in treatment of patients at increased risk of PMR relapse or glucocorticoid-related side effects. Other steroid-sparing therapies like HCQ, azathioprine, and other cytotoxics have been used, albeit with only limited success. While there are case reports and open-labeled studies indicating benefit with tocilizumab (an interleukin-6 inhibitor) in PMR, due to the lack of approval of tocilizumab for PMR and because of the absence of placebo-controlled trials, it should be considered only in individual cases as a second-line immunosuppressive agent. Analgesics may be added to improve pain symptoms. An NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor may be used as initial therapy in very mildly affected patients but should be changed over to corticosteroids if the marked improvement is not seen in 2 to 4 weeks.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NSAIDs do not alter ESR levels or suppress subclinical GCA if present. More frequently, these agents are used to provide adjunctive anti- inflammatory therapy to ongoing steroid therapy. Their use must be balanced against the risk of eliciting renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and hematologic side effects.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Giant Cell Arteritis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GCA is a systemic, granulomatous, segmental, and focal panarteritis usually focused along the internal elastic lamina of medium- and large-sized extracranial arteries. The aorta and branch vessels from the aortic arch are most frequently involved. Disease manifestations are generally the result of tissue-organ ischemia or necrosis downstream from the site of vascular occlusion. Certain disease manifestations are steroid-responsive but require higher doses at the initiation of therapy as contrasted against treatment for PMR.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology and pathoge nesis <span class="p">As in PMR, GCA is seen in patients older than 50 years, most commonly in Caucasians, women, and in those from northern Scandinavian ancestry, with an incidence rate of approximately 17 to 27 cases per 100,000 persons older than age 50, and prevalence rate of about 200 per 100,000. The disease is rare in the United States in those of African and Asian descent, with an associated incidence rate of approximately 1 case per 100,000 persons.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The cause of GCA is unknown, but histologic and biochemical evaluations of affected arteries suggest that it is an antigen-driven disease with a cell-mediated immune response. Like PMR, GCA shares genetic risk factors (such as susceptibility to HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DRB1*04 genotypes) and pathogenetic pathways involving both the innate and adaptive immune system. The cellular infiltrate throughout the vessel wall mirrors that seen in the synovium of patients with active PMR. Destruction of the arterial wall is centered on the elastic fibers of the internal elastic lamina. The process is thought to begin in the adventitia, where activated dendritic cells recruit CD4+ T-cells coexpressing CD161 into the vessel wall. Based on the cytokine milieu secreted by dendritic cells, these ultimate T-effector cells (1) following exposure to IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23, differentiate into IL-17 producing Th17 cells, or (2) following exposure to IL-12 and IL-18, differentiate into interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) producing T-helper-1 (Th1) cells. Research implicates these two independent inflammatory cytokine pathways in driving disease pathogenesis: the IL-17 axis thru activation of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts and associated with IL-6–mediated systemic/constitutional symptoms, and the IFN-γ axis activating macrophages, endothelial cells, and cytotoxic cells and associated with vascular occlusion and ischemic complications. The IL-17– mediated pathway is steroid-sensitive, whereas the IFN-γ pathway is</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">steroid-resistant and is the predominant cell type in intramural infiltrates. The activity of both pathways characterizes the early disease, but the chronic disease is characterized by persistent Th1-inducing signals, independent of IL-17–mediated inflammation. In combination with proteolytic enzymes and growth factors, a granulomatous reaction develops in the vessel wall, while secondary smooth muscle and matrix proliferation contributes to vascular occlusion.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical feature s and diagnostic criteria <span class="p">Most patients have clinical findings attributable to involved arteries during the illness. The most prevalent symptoms include headache (65%) in the distribution of either the temporal or occipital arteries, visual disturbance (30%), permanent visual loss (15%), jaw claudication symptoms (eg, from chewing or talking; 45%), dysphagia or swallowing claudication (8%), tongue claudication (6%), limb (usually arm) claudication (4%), and persistent cough or sore throat (4%). Rare manifestations include tinnitus and ischemia of the scalp or tongue.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Headaches may be severe, acute, and associated with scalp sensitivity in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">temporal and or occipital artery distributions. Typical PMR is seen in 40% to 60% and maybe the presenting finding in 25%. In approximately 25% of patients, nonerosive arthritis may be present, typically involving the metacarpophalangeal joints, wrists, and knees. Constitutional symptoms are common and may exist as the sole manifestation of disease. These include weight loss or anorexia (50%), fever (which may be prolonged and meet the criteria for fever of unknown etiology; 45%), fatigue (40%), and depression symptoms. Overall, the nonspecific nature of many of the symptoms mentioned above contributes to the delay, which on average can be weeks before the diagnosis is made. <span class="s1">Table 100-4 </span>lists the test characteristics of individual symptoms and their combinations as expressed by likelihood ratios.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 100-4 <span class="s3">■ </span>LIKELIHOOD RATIOS FOR SINGLE SYMPTOMS AND IN COMBINATION FOR GIANT CELL ARTERITIS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Examination reveals signs related to affected arteries in up to two-thirds of patients. Scalp artery tenderness (27%) is a less frequent finding than a decreased temporal pulse (46%) in one study. Care should be taken to differentiate temporal artery findings from the signs of radiating pain from ipsilateral C2 radiculopathy (tenderness in the paraspinal area of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ipsilateral upper cervical spine, pain exacerbated by head position or motion), or scalp pain radiating from a myofascial pain emanating from the suboccipital muscles at the base of the skull (focal muscular tenderness, which may “trigger” radiating pain into the temporal scalp). A swollen, nodular or erythematous scalp artery is detected with equal frequency as a large artery bruit (20%). Large vessel vasculitis occurs in 25% of patients. Involvement of the thoracic or abdominal aorta may lead to aneurysmal dilation and possibly rupture, usually occurring years after the onset of disease during a time when most patients are not otherwise thought to have active disease. Hypertension from renovascular involvement is rare.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Involvement of the ophthalmic, central retinal, and posterior ciliary arteries to the eye can cause optic nerve ischemic lesions (either anterior or posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, the former the commonest lesion and associated with partial or complete visual loss) or retinal ischemic lesions (either central retinal or cilioretinal artery occlusions which may also lead to severe visual loss). Fundoscopic exam revealing a chalky white edematous optic disc suggests infarction of the optic nerve head, whereas optic disc cupping is a late finding. Visual loss occurs in 10% to 15% of patients, may be sudden and without warning, with the risk for permanent loss increased in patients with prior transient loss. Warning signs include symptoms of amaurosis fugax, visual disturbance with postural change, or diplopia. Vision loss for more than a few hours only very rarely returns. Less common findings in patients with GCA include peripheral neuropathy, scalp necrosis, cerebral infarction, and lesions that may mimic CNS vasculitis, tinnitus, and deafness.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The ESR is usually markedly elevated, not uncommonly to 80 to 100 mm/h or higher. A normo to hypochromic anemia may be seen and can be accompanied by reactive thrombocytosis. Other acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, and alpha-2 globulin can be elevated; however, these measures, including an elevated ESR, should not be the only indication to begin immunosuppressive medication. A mild hepatic transaminitis and/or an elevated alkaline phosphatase can occur. The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies at presentation may be a poor prognostic marker for the subsequent development of vascular complications.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Radiographic investigations can help define the extent of disease but alone are rarely sufficient to diagnose GCA. The combination of positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT) using <span class="s22">18</span>F-</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fluorodeoxyglucose (<span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG) can detect hypermetabolic activity in vascular walls but cannot reliably distinguish between vasculitis and atherosclerotic changes. Therefore, PET/CT is most useful in patients with GCA with suspected involvement of the aorta and its major branches or when other diagnoses that mimic GCA should be ruled out. Some disadvantages of PET/CT are the high cost of the test, radiation exposure, and the intrinsic limitation of resolution to approximately 2.4 mm. Magnetic resonance (MR) or CT angiography of the aorta and its proximal major branches can demonstrate the vascular occlusion or dissection responsible for limb claudication, or clinically suspected aortic involvement, but wall thickening or delayed enhancement of the arterial wall may not change with treatment and is not a reliable measure of disease status. Doppler ultrasonography (US) of the temporal arteries may show hypoechoic changes representing edema of the vessel wall (“halo sign”) and decreased blood flow and velocity as noninvasive diagnostic signs of active inflammation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, Doppler US is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific to routinely replace diagnostic arterial biopsy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As clinical features are not specific, temporal artery biopsy remains the gold standard diagnostic test. The yield is increased when the artery to be biopsied is palpably or visibly abnormal. As the pathologic changes in an involved artery tend to occur as skip lesions along its length, a biopsy specimen of a minimum of 1 cm, preferably greater than 2 cm, is preferred. The artery should be sectioned at 3- to 5-mm intervals before microscopic examination. The need for biopsy should not delay steroid therapy, but biopsy performance should preferably occur within the first few days of steroid use. Prior or ongoing therapy with steroids (eg, in a patient with PMR) should not prevent a decision to confirm the diagnosis by biopsy if the patient has active signs and symptoms of GCA. The temporal artery is the preferred site for biopsy, although a diagnosis can be confirmed by biopsy from a symptomatic occipital artery. A positive biopsy demonstrates evidence of vasculitis centered at the intima-media junction with a predominance of mononuclear cell infiltrates or granulomatous inflammation, usually with multinucleated giant cells. However, multinucleated giant cells are found in only 50% of specimens. Rarely is the inflammation restricted to the vasa vasorum or periadventitial small vessels. Histologic changes of GCA need to be distinguished from the normal changes in aging vessels, although distinguishing between “healed arteritis” and senescent changes may</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be difficult at best due to a significant overlap in the microscopic findings. Normal senescent changes in the temporal artery include progressive and relatively regular intimal thickening, medial degeneration and thinning with occasional calcium deposition, focal internal elastic fiber fracture, and fibrosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">An initial negative biopsy occurs in up to one-third of patients and should first lead to a careful reevaluation of the specimen. Biopsy of the contralateral artery infrequently provides pathologic confirmation when the initial biopsy is negative but may be pursued in a patient for whom the diagnosis remains in doubt, especially if systemic symptoms predominate and there is a very high clinical suspicion for GCA. The diagnostic sensitivity of a temporal artery biopsy remains high even if steroid therapy was begun preoperatively, but biopsy is ideally not delayed for more than 1 week. A negative biopsy does not preclude a diagnosis of GCA if sufficient other clinical findings are present. It is a situation more commonly seen in patients who have predominately subclavian artery involvement.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for GCA have become de facto diagnostic criteria in clinical practice (<span class="s1">Table 100-5</span>). These criteria provide structure to diagnose if artery biopsy is either not available or temporal artery abnormality is not present. In the original derivation, the criteria had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 91%.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 100-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR GIANT CELL ARTERITIS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The risk of acute visual loss mandates that corticosteroid therapy be initiated in anyone suspected of having GCA, even before the temporal artery biopsy. Initial doses of 1 mg/kg (eg, 40–60 mg) of prednisone per day in a single morning dose, higher than starting doses for PMR, are standard. Even higher doses of 15 mg/kg (eg, 1000 mg given intravenously) per day are suggested for patients with active visual symptoms. The initial dose is maintained for 4 to 8 weeks to suppress clinical symptoms and normalize the ESR and/or CRP, slowly tapered over months. Most patients require an average of 2 years of therapy to control symptoms. One suggested schedule for tapering is to reduce the initial dose by 10 mg every 2 to 4 weeks until 40 mg daily is</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reached, then by 5 mg every 2 to 4 weeks until 20 mg daily, followed by a reduction of 2.5 mg every 2 to 4 weeks until 10 mg/day. After that, the dose is tapered following the pattern for patients with PMR, by 1 mg every 2 to 4 weeks. Disease exacerbations during tapering of steroids or after completion of therapy occur in up to two-thirds of patients, are more commonly manifested as PMR than ischemic complications, and require a transient increase or resumption in dose followed by further attempts at weaning.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are no clinical predictors for those at risk for relapse. The ESR is an imperfect indicator of disease activity and must be used in combination with clinical symptoms to assess disease and adjustment of therapy. Persistent elevation of ESR despite the absence of clinical disease activity may indicate silent large vessel disease (eg, aortitis) or be associated with another condition such as an unrecognized infection masked by steroid use.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The efficacy and glucocorticoid-sparing effects of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor α inhibitor, in GCA were recently demonstrated in the GiACTA trial. Based on the results of this study, which included 251 patients with GCA, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of tocilizumab in GCA. For patients with new-onset GCA who are at increased risk of developing glucocorticoid-related adverse effects or complications, relapse, or prolonged therapy and in patients who experience relapse, tocilizumab should be instituted early on in the course of treatment. A clinical trial involving 41 patients with GCA showed that more patients treated with abatacept (selective T-cell costimulation inhibitor) had relapse- free survival at 12 months (compared to placebo) but did not make a difference on the overall frequency and severity of adverse events. There may be a modest benefit from methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent to lower relapse rates and total cumulative steroid dose, but steroid-associated side effects are not reduced. Infliximab was not effective as a steroid-sparing agent, and only anecdotal reports of utility for this purpose are described for trials of dapsone, adalimumab, leflunomide, HCQ, and azathioprine. Low- dose aspirin has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of cranial ischemic events (particularly anterior ischemic optic neuropathy), and aspirin is known to reduce IFN-γ levels. All patients beginning steroids should be started on bone-protective therapy. Prophylaxis against infection from <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii </i>should be considered for those on a daily prednisone dose of 20 mg or higher. As aortic aneurysms occur more frequently in patients with GCA within 10 years of diagnosis, a yearly chest</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">radiograph should be performed, with more sensitive studies such as chest CT reserved for patients with equivocal plain radiographic findings.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Although the life expectancy of patients with GCA is similar to that of the age-matched general population, unless severe aortitis is present, morbidity from the disease itself and its therapy may be substantial. Twenty to fifty percent of patients develop toxicities from corticosteroids. Thus, the impact of disease manifestations and the side effects of therapy cannot be underestimated in older people.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Aggarwal R, Bandos A, Reed AM, et al.

This is mirrored by a growing knowledge of the many immune system changes in aging, and clinicians’ experience in administration of biological therapies in older adults with rheumatic diseases. While the field of rheumatology continues to focus on individual rheumatic illnesses, there is also a greater appreciation of the corresponding risks and side effects of these powerful agents on older patients with polypharmacy and multiple comorbid illnesses. This chapter summarizes recent key advances, with specific references to the geriatric population.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that preferentially affects diarthrodial joints. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR), in collaboration with the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), updated the classification criteria of RA in 2010 (<span class="s1">Table 101-1</span>). The impetus for updating the original 1987 criteria was the recognition of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of this disease. The new classification criteria therefore no longer include late sequelae of RA such as rheumatoid nodules or radiographic evidence of bony erosions.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new set of criteria should allow the study and treatment of patients with earlier stages of the disease. It should be noted that the new classification</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">criteria apply to patients with objective evidence of synovitis in at least one joint, and the synovitis is not better explained by another disease such as lupus, psoriatic arthritis, or crystal-associated arthritis. It is also important to understand that the mean age of patients in the nine arthritis cohorts used to develop the new classification criteria ranges from 46 to 58 years. While the criteria set is useful for diagnosing early and active disease in younger patients, its usefulness in detecting community late-onset (&gt; 60 years old) rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) has not been established. This is important because the disease presentation in LORA may be distinct from that of</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">young-onset RA (YORA).</p><p

Anti-CCP antibodies are as sensitive (70%–78%) as, and more specific (88%–96%) than IgM RF in early and fully established disease. Furthermore, the presence of these antibodies is a marker for erosive disease and may predict the eventual development of RA in patients presenting with undifferentiated arthritis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These antibodies may also be detected in healthy individuals, years before the onset of clinical RA. Anti-CCP antibodies may be helpful in assessing arthritis symptoms in high-risk groups, such as those with a strong family history of RA. Unlike classical RF, the incidence of anti-CCP antibodies does not appear to increase with normal aging, making it a particularly useful marker for this disease in older patient population.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition to classification criteria for the diagnosis of RA, the ACR has established criteria for functional status and for determining clinical remission in RA. The usefulness of these classification systems in older patients who often suffer functional disability from concomitant osteoarthritis, soft-tissue rheumatism, and cardiovascular or neurologic diseases is unclear.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epidemiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The overall incidence of RA has been declining for a few decades. Interestingly, a long-term study from Mayo Clinic suggests that this may no longer be true. The study examined medical records in Olmsted County, Minnesota between 1985 and 2014, and found a steady incidence of age, sex, and race-adjusted RA. However, incidence of RF-positive RA decreased and incidence of RF-negative RA increased in 2005 to 2014 as compared with previous decades. The authors speculated that changing prevalence of environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, and others may have contributed to this trend.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The disease affects approximately 0.8% of the population in the United States and in many Western developed countries. Lower prevalence rates of 0.2% to 0.3% have been observed in China, Japan, some regions in Greece, and Africa. Southern Europeans may have a milder disease, with less extra- articular complications and less evidence of radiographic damage.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conversely, a much higher prevalence rate (up to 7%) and a more aggressive clinical course have been reported in several American-Indian and Alaska</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">native populations. Gender and age are important factors in RA. Overall, women are affected by the disease two to three times more than men.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, this gender parity disappears in old age. The prevalence of RA increases with age and is commonest in the oldest group studied (often 65 years and older or 70 years and older). Approximately 5% of women older than 55 are affected by the disease. The incidence of RA also increases with age, with the peak incidence occurring in the sixth to eighth decades (<span class="s1">Figure 101-1</span>). The reason for the age-associated increase in disease susceptibility is currently unknown.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 101-1. </span>Age-related incidence of rheumatoid arthritis.

In the future, RA and other autoimmune disease may be subclassified</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">based on the individual’s genetic and molecular signatures, helping clinicians select the most appropriate treatment(s). RA is characterized by the activation and recruitment of T cells to the synovium, which set into motion a complex cascade of inflammatory responses (<span class="s1">Figure 101-2</span>). These responses result in further accumulation of inflammatory cells, panus formation, localized osteoporosis, bony erosions, and destruction of periarticular structures, which are characteristic of this disease. Rheumatoid synovitis is accompanied by the accumulation of inflammatory joint fluid with white cell count typically in the range of 2000 to 20,000 cells/mL. Soluble proteins that have been implicated in the inflammatory process include a number of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL- 13, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), metalloproteinases (stromelysin, collagenases, and gelatinases), transforming growth factor-β, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and activated complement components.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIGURE 101-2. <span class="s5">The inflammatory cascade in rheumatoid arthritis.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Genetic factors play an important role in RA susceptibility. The association between RA and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) has been refined to alleles coding for a “shared” epitope (the sequences QRRAA or QKRAA) on the HLA-DRB1 genes. The presence of the DRB1<span class="s22">*</span>04 (DR4) allele is a marker for increased susceptibility and severe disease. Population</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">differences in the prevalence of the “shared epitope” may help to explain in part the geographic variation in the prevalence of RA. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 50 genetic susceptibility loci, including the HLA-DRB1 allele, and. may help explain racial and geographical differences in RA susceptibility. Importantly, GWAS have identified new and exciting pharmaceutical targets for this disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">An infectious etiology for RA has been postulated for more than half a century. Acute and chronic “reactive” arthritis can follow specific gastrointestinal (GI) or genital urinary infection. A transient RA-like illness can be seen in viral infections including parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1. Accumulating evidence suggests that “dysbiosis” of the oral and intestinal microbiomes may be important in RA pathogenesis. <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>, which causes periodontal diseases and contains the citrullination enzyme peptidyl-arginine deiminase, has been linked to RA autoantibody formation and joint inflammation. Dysbiosis in older adults, usually referred to as inflammaging, contributes to the chronic low-grade proinflammatory state, and may influence characterization of RA in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">RA had been considered to be primarily a Th (T helper) 1-mediated disease based on the cytokine and chemokine receptor profile of T cells in synovial joints. The related Th 17 (IL-23/IL-17) pathway may also be important in driving disease chronicity and joint destruction, although targeting the IL-23/IL-17 pathway has only modest success in RA compared to other forms of inflammatory arthritis. Although it is tempting to postulate that RA-associated DRB1 epitope triggers disease by presenting an arthrogenic peptide to T cells, extensive search of unique peptides that are displayed selectively by RA-associated HLA molecules has so far been unsuccessful. Costimulatory molecules, including CD28 and CD60, may play a role in activating T cells in RA joints. Dysfunctional T and non-T cell immune signaling has been increasingly recognized to be important in RA pathogenesis. This has resulted in the successful development of tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor), as a novel therapy for RA. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">precise contribution of B cells in RA pathogenesis is less well defined. The recent success of B cell depletion therapy has refocused attention on the role of these immune cells beyond autoantibody production, including plasma cells differentiation, and their immunomodulating effects on proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aging effects <span class="p">The reason for the age-associated increase in RA susceptibility is unclear. The traditional view that aging is associated with a “decline” in immune response does not explain the high incidence and severe onset of this autoimmune disease that is commonly seen in older adults. Decline in sex hormone production also cannot account for the high incidence of RA in postmenopausal women. Age-related decline in thymic function has been suggested as a possible mechanism in autoimmunity in aging. While features of accelerated immune system aging are prevalent in RA patients, it is unclear if these represent primary or secondary events. Unlike in their younger counterparts, LORA occurs with equal frequency in men and women. Again, the rising incidence of RA in postmenopausal women suggests that reproductive hormones may influence the disease manifestation. However, they are unlikely to play a major pathogenic role in older adult population.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A central role of T cells in RA pathogenesis is well established, and enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines in aging, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1, important in the recruitment of T cells to RA joints may contribute to the increased susceptibility and severity of RA in older patients. Aging-associated obesity and changes in the gut microbiota may be important sources of chronic low-grade inflammation in older patients, which in turn may play a role in age-related diseases such as coronary artery disease, metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer disease, and cancer.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether LORA is a different disease from YORA is controversial. The clinical studies that address the issue were mostly descriptive or cross- sectional studies done in the 1950s and 1960s that have significant methodologic problems. The older definition of RA used in these studies also allowed terms such as “classical,” “definite,” and “probable” RA, which are no longer used today. As mentioned before, the most current RA classification criteria have not been validated in older patients.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Table 101-2 <span class="p">summarizes the features of LORA. In general, patients with LORA have a more equal gender distribution. The large joints, including the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">shoulder joint, are more often involved at presentation in LORA. Whether this is a result of concomitant rotator cuff disease that is prevalent in this age group is unclear. Symptoms in the proximal girdles have led to the belief that LORA may present with a polymyalgia rheumatica-like illness. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) normally increases with age, especially in women. Elevated ESR is also more common in LORA. The prevalence of RF similarly increases after the age of 60 years, reaching 30% by the age of 90 years. Earlier reports suggest a lower frequency of RF in LORA than YORA. However, this has not been confirmed in more recent studies. As in younger patients, patients with LORA who are seropositive for RF have more severe clinical disease, more bony erosions on x-ray, worse functional outcome, and increased mortality. Whether patients with LORA who are seropositive have worse prognosis than do their younger counterparts is unclear. It is possible that the poor prognosis of LORA reported in some studies reflects the greater number of comorbid conditions that are present in older patients.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 101-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>CLINICAL FEATURES OF OLDER ADULT-ONSET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">“Benign polyarthritis in older adults” occurs in up to a third of patients with LORA. They have a more explosive disease onset associated with systemic features such as fever and night sweats. The clinical features have led some to describe the disease as “infectious like.” The disease is called</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">benign because its general prognosis is good, with most people going into remission within 1 year with or without treatment. Within this group can be included a peculiar syndrome unique to older patients called the RS<span class="s11">3</span>PE</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(remitting, seronegative, and symmetric synovitis with pitting edema) syndrome. This typically affects older adult men (2–3:1, male to female ratio) and is characterized by acute onset of symmetric polyarthritis/tenosynovitis with pitting edema involving both upper and lower extremities. As the name implies, these patients generally have negative RF and antinuclear antibody (ANA). They often have high ESR and respond to low-dose prednisone. The association with HLA-B7 has been reported inconsistently. RS<span class="s11">3</span>PE may occasionally be associated with other</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rheumatic diseases, including polymyalgia rheumatica, spondyloarthropathies, psoriatic arthritis, RA, and sarcoid, and, rarely, malignancies.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The assessment of RA in older adults is different from that of the younger age group. The nonspecific symptoms and signs of RA are prevalent in older patients. Rheumatic diseases that can mimic LORA, such as polymyalgia rheumatica, osteoarthritis, and crystal-induced arthritis, are prevalent in the older patient population. Anti-CCP antibody measurement may be useful in distinguishing LORA from polymyalgia rheumatica. In one small study, 65% of patients with LORA were anti-CCP antibody positive, but none of the patients with PMR or aged healthy subjects had the antibodies. Arthritis associated with malignancy can be misdiagnosed as RA before the correct diagnosis is made months or years later. Other differential diagnoses of RA in older population include inflammatory (erosive) osteoarthritis, late-onset spondyloarthropathy, endocrinopathy (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and diabetic cheiroarthropathy), amyloidosis, and the edematous phase of scleroderma. Conditions such as sarcoidosis, adult Still disease, hemochromatosis, and glycogen storage diseases can mimic RA but are unlikely to present for the first time so late in life. In addition to the above considerations, the initial evaluation of an older patient with RA should include a careful assessment of the patient’s living condition, social support, and cognitive and functional status. Many older patients have the misconception that there is no effective treatment for arthritis, and they should accept their physical suffering as part of normal aging. Older adults</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">may feel embarrassed about or minimize their symptoms of arthritis by using terms such as “aching” and “stiff” instead of pain. Unfortunately, many clinicians also do not take their symptoms seriously, resulting in older adults receiving less aggressive treatment and the patients frequently feeling that their care resembles “a lick and a promise.” Because pain is, by far, the commonest presenting symptom of RA, pain assessment should be an integral part of the patient’s evaluation at presentation and in subsequent office visits. This can be difficult in older patients who have significant cognitive or verbal impairment. Information from caregivers, nonverbal pain behavior, physical and radiographic evidence of active joint inflammation, and decline in function are important clues that more aggressive therapy may be necessary.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The ACR classification system for assessing the functional status of patients with RA is shown in <span class="s1">Table 101-3</span>. However, use of this classification for an older patient may be difficult because of functional disability from other coexisting diseases. This quick assessment tool is useful for describing the global functional status and allows patients to be grouped for studies. Patients with RA with the worst (class IV) functional status were reported to have extremely poor prognosis, with survival similar</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to patients with multiple vessel coronary artery disease and stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma. More recently the ACR recommended five RA disease activity measures including the Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) with ESR or C-reactive protein (CRP), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), along with three patient- reported functional status assessment measures including the Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function 10-item short form and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) for routine use in clinical practice in patients with RA. These composite measures containing patient, provider, laboratory, and/or imaging data have been used to evaluate physical, mental, and social health in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many clinicians now feel that the prognosis for RA has improved with the advent of better therapeutic regimens for RA in the past two decades.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether this translates into prolonged survival remains to be determined. Concomitant medical conditions affecting the patient’s hearing, eyesight, continence, and balance need to be addressed to optimize functional ability and to prevent falls. Current and past medical histories are important elements of the initial evaluation. This information is needed for the selection</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of specific treatment (see “Management” section). In contrast, family history is not as clinically helpful in assessing older patients with RA.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 101-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY 1991 REVISED CRITERIA FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF GLOBAL FUNCTIONAL STATUS IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition to excluding the diseases mentioned above, a new patient suspected of having RA should be tested for the presence of anemia, cytopenia, liver or renal dysfunction, RF, anti-CCP, and elevated inflammatory markers of ESR and CRP. The presence of extremely high RF should prompt the clinician to consider the possible diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. Some patients have negative RF but positive ANA. These patients tend to have more severe disease, similar to the patients with positive RF. A work-up for secondary Sjögren syndrome should be done in patients with concurrent sicca symptoms (dry eye and dry mouth). In general, ESR is a better indicator of disease activity than changes in the titer of RF. For some patients CRP level may more closely parallel their clinical course than ESR. Anti-CCP titer is not useful in following RA disease activity, although patients with reduced anti-CCP antibodies may have less joint damage in the long run. Anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">antibodies have been touted as potentially new biomarkers for RA; early studies suggest the test could be a better predictor of aggressive disease and bone erosion than the anti-CCP test. Age does not appear to impact anti- MCV antibody titer, although this has not been demonstrated to be true in older RA population. A multibiomarker blood test of 12 proteins, Vectra DA, for determining RA disease activity has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The test has good correlation with traditional clinical assessment of RA disease activity. The test is intended to complement, and not replace, sound clinical judgment. The test could be a useful objective tool in older RA patients who are unable to provide reliable feedback to the clinician because of impaired cognitive function or other comorbidities. “Cytokine panel” can be measured to examine for individual patient’s proinflammatory cytokine profile, but its role in personalized medicine (eg, choosing between anti-TNF versus another class of biologic therapy) and improving clinical outcomes has not been established.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Radiographic joint examination is an integral part of the evaluation of patients with RA. Older patients with RA for more than 10 years are at particular risk of cervical spine disease and atlantoaxial joint instability. This is an important consideration before a patient is intubated, as overextension of the cervical spine may compromise the brainstem or spinal cord. Early x-ray changes include soft-tissue swelling and regional osteoporosis around the joint. Typical erosions in hands and feet involve the juxta-articular “bare areas” of bone not covered with cartilage (<span class="s1">Figure 101- 3</span>). Isolated erosions in the first and second metacarpophalangeal joints may prompt the clinician to search for occult calcium pyrophosphate depositive disease, hyperparathyroidism, or hemochromatosis. Erosions are less common in the knee and hip joints. At these sites, RA typically causes cartilage loss and joint-space narrowing. Joint-space narrowing occurring predominantly in the lateral compartment of the knee and diffusely in the hip without bony proliferation is helpful for distinguishing RA from osteoarthritis. To assess joint-space narrowing of the knees, clinicians should request semiflexed weight-bearing films.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 101-3. </span>Radiographic changes of rheumatoid arthritis. <b>(A) </b>An x-ray of the cervical spine in the flexed position showing severe atlantoaxial joint subluxation in a patient with chronic rheumatoid arthritis, with <i>arrows </i>highlighting the abnormal distance between the posterior surface of the anterior arch of the atlas and the anterior surface of the odontoid process.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><i>Arrowhead </i>points to the erosion on the surface of C5. <b>(B) </b>Early erosive changes in the metacarpal phalangeal joints affecting the “bare area” of the bone not protected by cartilage.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><b>(C) </b>Bilateral hand x-ray with advanced rheumatoid arthritis.

The majority of patients with treated disease and considered by their physicians to be in remission continue to have evidence of active synovitis in advanced imaging such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The unanswered question is whether more aggressive treatments of patient with clinically inactive disease but imaging evidence of ongoing synovitis affect patient outcomes such as overtreatment (and drug side effects), and long-term disability. Moreover, older patients with RA have additional facets that need to be taken into consideration, such as a more limited lifespan and greater infection risk with immunosuppression. Although embraced by many rheumatologists, the utility of these sensitive imaging modalities in clinical practice remains incompletely defined. The ACR “Choosing Wisely” recommendations recommend that MRI of the peripheral joints should not be used to routinely monitor inflammatory arthritis. And the ACR Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Committee recognizes that the imaging modality may be reasonable to use in many clinical scenarios in rheumatology practice, but lacks cost-effectiveness data.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is no evidence that patients with LORA are more likely to develop extra-articular disease, as compared to those with YORA. However, older patients may be disproportionately affected because extra-articular manifestations are more common in chronic RA. High titer of RF is a risk factor for extra-articular RA, especially in male patients. Rheumatoid nodules are the most characteristic extra-articular manifestation of RA and are present in up to 40% of seropositive White patients. These are most commonly found in areas of pressure such as the elbows, heels, and sacrum. Their presence does not correlate with disease activity and may increase in number during methotrexate therapy when synovitis is improving.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rheumatoid vasculitis affects vessels of all sizes. This complication may present as cutaneous vasculitis, mononeuritis multiplex, nail fold infarcts, or deep “punched-out” ulcers at atypical sites that fail to respond to conventional therapy. Pleuritis and pericarditis are found in 20% to 30% of patients with RA and do not usually cause any symptoms. Other respiratory complications of RA include pulmonary granuloma (often in the upper lobes), Caplan syndrome, fibrosing alveolitis, and bronchiolitis obliterans. Felty syndrome (RA with splenomegaly and neutropenia) typically occurs in White patients with long-standing, chronic erosive RA. These patients are at increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative malignancies.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thrombocytopenia may occur, in part, because of splenic sequestration. Mild-to-moderate normochromic, normocytic anemia is extremely common in patients with chronic RA. Iatrogenic causes (eg, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and methotrexate) of anemia need to be excluded in all patients with RA who have anemia.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A number of treatment concepts and standards have emerged in RA clinical management. There is increasing recognition of the benefits of early and aggressive therapies in improving the long-term outcomes of RA. Outdated treatment goals have focused on improving patient symptoms by 25% or 50%. The concept of “treat-to-target” has long been embraced by clinicians treating diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. A similar “treat-to-target” approach has gained wide acceptance in RA management, utilizing composite disease activity indexes that have traditionally been confined to research, such as the DAS-28 or CDAI. The advent of biological therapies has allowed clinicians to aim for disease</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">remission in many RA patients. And patients with poor prognostic factors of female sex, seropositive for RF and anti-CCP, increased inflammatory markers, functional limitations, and erosive changes on radiography have benefited from early initiation of biologic therapy. Nevertheless, there are unanswered questions about this aggressive management approach. These include lack of consensus on what disease activity measurements should be used and frequency of monitoring. And important issues to be addressed in future research include treatment burden (including cost and side effects), and benefits in remaining life (prognostication) in older patients with multi- comorbid diseases.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic the rapies <span class="p">Successful management of RA involves patient participation in his/her care. In addition, family, social, and psychological supports are particularly critical in maintaining the older RA patient’s independence. Older patients diagnosed with the disease may be particularly fearful of what it means to their independence or may become depressed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Establishing a good rapport, gaining the trust of the patient and the family, providing information about the nature of the disease, and setting realistic goals are all important elements of the initial management of RA. Many patients and their relatives also find it helpful to seek out support groups in their local area. Increasingly, older patients and their families are turning to the Internet, health magazines, and other nontraditional sources for information about treatment options, including over-the-counter complementary therapies. There is a need for health care professionals to become knowledgeable in web and social media medical resources.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unexpected side effects of over-the-counter medications are increasingly being recognized. The latest information is often not available in traditional textbooks. Directing the patients to reputable websites such as those offered by the National Institute on Aging, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, the Cochrane Reviews, the American College of Rheumatology, or the Arthritis Foundation can be useful for more up-to-date information.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic therapies are crucial components of the total care of the patient with RA, which should be emphasized throughout the treatment course. In addition to their inherent usefulness, participation in these treatment modalities often provides the patients and their families with a sense of control over their chronic illness. The interprofessional team approach that typifies geriatric medicine is eminently suitable for treating</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">older patients with chronic arthritis. Physical and occupational therapy should be offered to every patient with RA, including those with mild and early disease. Education about rest/activity, use of cold/heat, massage, and adaptive devices (to improve function and to prevent/correct joint deformity) are important. Performing exercises to strengthen muscles and ligaments for joint protection, gait training, and fall prevention can make a big difference in the life of patients with RA. Community-based exercise programs, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-endorsed Arthritis Foundation Exercise Program (AFEP), are a good resource for those who are able to participate. Psychological counseling and support groups are often helpful, especially to those who are socially isolated because of their arthritis. Depression is increasingly recognized as a common problem in older patients and in those with chronic illness. Adequate treatment will help break the vicious cycle of pain, depression, and disability. Although nonpharmacologic therapies do not affect the progression of RA joint destruction, they can improve the patient’s quality of life and help to reduce the requirement for pain medications that have significant potential for side effects in this vulnerable population.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Pharmacologic the rapies </span>There is an explosion of new drugs available for the treatment of RA. In particular, the number of biological response modifiers available to clinicians has expanded considerably, and many more are in the late stages of clinical development. The success of these agents, which target soluble inflammatory proteins, T cells, and B cells, suggests that targeting the downstream mediators may be sufficient to modulate the disease. The mechanism of action, monitoring considerations, and common side effects of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), and biologic DAMRDs (bDMARDs) are summarized in <span class="s1">Table 101-4</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox"

gradualism of the “pyramid approach” to RA treatment in the 1980s has been replaced with the widespread “treat-to-target” approach that aims to suppress RA disease activity as completely and as soon as possible once the diagnosis is confirmed. This change in philosophy is, in part, a result of the recognition that joint damage occurs much sooner than was previously believed. Results of well-designed clinical trials have persuaded many that this new standard is attainable with more aggressive and early initiation of drug regimens. The 2021 ACR Guideline for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis provides updated recommendations for the pharmacologic management of RA, taking into consideration current disease activity, prior therapies used, and the presence of comorbidities (<span class="s1">Table 101-5</span>). For DMARD-naïve RA patients with moderate-to-high disease activity, methotrexate monotherapy is recommended over other csDMARD (as dual or triple therapy), bDMARD, or tsDMARD therapy. Oral methotrexate is recommended at initiation, and those not at target may switch to subcutaneous methotrexate for better bioavailability. For RA patients not at target despite maximal tolerated methotrexate use, addition of bDMARD or tsDMARD is recommended, over triple therapy of methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sulfasalazine. If patients have inadequate response to a bDMARD or tsDMARD, they may switch to a different class of biologic-modifying DMARD.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 101-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>2021 ACR GUIDELINES FOR PHAMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT OF RA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Clinicians are often reluctant to use csDMARDs such as methotrexate and leflunomide as monotherapy because of their limited efficacy, high</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dropout rate, and potential serious side effects, especially in older patients. Great caution and dose adjustment are often needed when using these drugs to treat older adults with RA, especially in those with a history of renal and liver failure. The use of bDMARD or tsDMARDs in combination with or without methotrexate can boost the therapeutic efficacy of selected biologics. However, whether older patients tolerate combination therapies as well as monotherapy is uncertain.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Rituximab may be of benefit in patients with RA refractory to other biologic therapy and extra-articular manifestations such as rheumatoid vasculitis and interstitial lung disease. The main advantage of using combination of csDMARD therapy over the anticytokine biologic treatments is cost. Many European countries and US insurance companies continue to require patients to have a trial of methotrexate before receiving biologic therapies. An important advantage of biologic agents is rapid onset of action, with many patients experiencing improvement within a few weeks of treatment. These agents appear to be effective in patients with both seropositive and seronegative RA. The author has also found in his own practice that biologics are more efficacious in reducing specific symptoms such as fatigue in RA patients, compared to csDMARDs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As new data emerge and new therapies become available, it is anticipated that updated treatment guidelines will be available much more frequently than in the past. However, older adults are often excluded from clinical trials, leaving a gap in knowledge on the efficacy and safety of RA treatment with DMARDs. It will be important to draw from limited clinical trial data and observational studies to understand how the new guidelines apply to older RA patients, especially in those with multiple medical conditions. Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly included older adults in pre- and postmarketing clinical trials. Additionally, there are an increasing number of rheumatology research consortia and registries that have provided “real world” data on the benefits and side effects of new treatments on older RA patients. Knowing that these agents may be efficacious in older patients provides some reassurance to clinicians.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, it is important to remember that subjects participating in these studies rarely mirror the patients geriatricians see in their clinic who have multiple comorbidities and who already suffer from polypharmacy. The decision as to which biological modifier to use will depend on individual patient characteristics such as comorbidity, patient preferences such as</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">administration schedule, physician experience, and insurance coverage owing to the high cost of these drugs. Because of the complexity of modern treatment regimens, coupled with the need to monitor many potentially serious side effects, drug therapy for RA should ideally be instituted in consultation with a rheumatologist. Involvement of physicians experienced in the use of immunosuppressive therapies (eg, hematologists and oncologists, or a gastroenterologist in the case of infliximab) will be helpful in patients living in isolated communities where there may not be a local rheumatologist.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s248">Safety and Other Issues with Biologics </span>While there is little doubt about the potential efficacy of the biologics in RA, there remains significant concern about their side effects, especially in vulnerable populations such as older patients with RA having multiple comorbidities. One useful acronym for the safe use of biologics is CONSIDER, outlined in <span class="s1">Table 101-6</span>. TNF is involved in host defense against foreign pathogens and in tumor surveillance. The most important risk associated with anticytokine therapy for older patients with RA is the increased incidence of fungal infections, tuberculosis, and atypical mycobacterial infections. The incidences of infections and serious infection were higher among older adults with RA compared to younger patients enrolled in the community-based Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America (CORRONA) registry. Moreover, infection risks associated with tofacitinib were comparable to that of other biologic DMARDs such as anti-TNF therapies. As tuberculosis is usually caused by reactivation of latent infection, tuberculosis skin testing or interferon-gamma release assay and a chest x-ray should be done prior to starting these agents. Whether yearly tuberculosis screening and chest x-ray to detect new exposure are necessary in countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis is unclear. Yearly screening is recommended for selected patients who are at risk, such as those who travel regularly to TB endemic areas and nursing home residents.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent:

cases of demyelinating disorders, aplastic anemia, lupus-like illnesses, and depression have also been associated with anti-TNF therapies. The long-term consequences of anticytokine suppression are unknown. One meta-analysis reported a fourfold higher rate of malignancies in patients treated with TNF inhibitors.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Rituximab dramatically lowers the peripheral blood B-cell count for months after the infusion, and these patients also have lower IgG and IgM levels. The use of rituximab has been associated with the reactivation of JC polyomavirus infection, resulting in the disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. This complication, although very rare, highlights the potential for the development of all B-cell–dependent viral diseases in patients receiving the drug. Interestingly, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has also been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis receiving natalizumab, a chimeric anti-α4 integrin antibody.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients on rituximab are at risk for hepatitis B reactivation, and should be screened for the virus before initiation of therapy. Interestingly, rituximab has been successfully used in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated cryoglobulinemia without worsening of HVC-associated liver disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Are biologics “cost effective” in the treatment of older adults with rheumatic diseases? Cost effectiveness for young patients with RA is based on remaining in the workforce, but there are no such data for the geriatric cohort of retirees, and it is hard to define the economic value of improved functional status or quality of life. Wide variability has been observed in the prescription of biologics for older adults and their economic impact is all the more elusive. Changes in frailty, falls, fractures, hospitalization for serious infections, and potentially inappropriate medication use may provide alternative measures of cost effectiveness of RA treatment in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The US FDA approved several “biosimilars” for adalimumab, infliximab, and rituximab, and increasing competition among the growing number of biologics is anticipated to help drive down the cost. Additionally, lower doses (than FDA guidelines) and, in some cases, reducing dose frequencies or duration of biologic treatments may be acceptable in selected patients to reduce risk of side effects and cost without adversely affecting outcomes.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As in other populations, cardiovascular disease is the single largest cause of death in patients with autoimmune inflammatory disorders.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, after accounting for the known traditional risk factors for heart diseases, patients with RA and lupus are at greater risk of developing coronary artery disease and stroke than those without these conditions. The reason for the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with these disorders of autoimmunity is not clear. Furthermore, a patient with RA who has a myocardial infarction has a similar prognosis as that of a diabetic patient with a similar event. Conventional therapies, such as the use of lipid- lowering agents, may not reverse the cardiovascular risk associated with these inflammatory conditions. While not proven, it is hoped that use of more aggressive immunosuppressive regimens will help reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. Aging per se has been described by some as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that has been termed “inflamm-aging,” which may play a role in frailty and sarcopenia in both normal aging and chronic inflammatory conditions such as RA. Current data do not support an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in tocilizumab-treated RA patients, despite the drug’s propensity to increase lipid levels.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A disease-associated inflammatory state, chronic use of steroids, and the lack of exercise owing to arthritis-associated disability may all contribute to the high incidence of osteoporosis in older patients with rheumatic diseases. Since these are chronic conditions, aggressive treatment with antiresorptive agents, adequate calcium intake, and vitamin D to prevent and treat osteoporosis and fracture is critical.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Many RA therapies involve significant immunosuppression that may affect the patient’s ability to mount an antibody response to immunization, worsening the already-impaired immune reaction as a result of immune senescence in older patients. It is, therefore, important that these patients are given their age-appropriate immunizations such as pneumococcal and flu vaccines preferably prior to receiving therapy with biologics. Patients already on biologics should avoid receiving any live vaccines.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Glucocorticoid Use in Treatment of RA <span class="p">Clinicians continue to debate the role of glucocorticoids in the management of RA, despite intriguing data showing that in early disease it may be “disease modifying,” because of frequent difficulty tapering and negative impacts associated with unintended prolonged glucocorticoid use. There is general consensus that high-dose chronic oral glucocorticoids should not be used in RA. Low-dose glucocorticoid may be considered for short-term (&lt; 3 months) symptom</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">control in patients with active RA. Unfortunately, older patients commonly develop significant side effects and become functionally dependent on the drug. Medicare beneficiaries older than age 75 with RA receiving less than or equal to 5 mg, more than 5 to 10 mg, or more than 10 mg of glucocorticoid per day had a 20%, 32%, and 47% increased risk for serious infection, respectively, compared to 13% risk in nonglucocorticoid users. In addition to dose-dependency, the risk of serious infection increases with prolonged use of glucocorticoids even at low dose. Older RA patients in Canada (mean age 74) taking as little as 5 mg prednisolone had a 30%, 46%, or 100% increased risk of serious infection when used continuously for the prior 3 months, 6 months, or 3 years, respectively, compared to nonsteroid users.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overall, it is important to use the lowest dose of glucocorticoids, with alternate day dosing if possible, for the shortest duration of time possible in this population, and to discontinue the drug when it is feasible. Interestingly, provider preference is one of the strongest predictors of RA patients receiving long-term glucocorticoids use. Assessment, prophylaxis, and treatment of osteoporosis, cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes, and GI complications are important. Judicious use of intra-articular steroid injections may provide local (and systemic) symptom relief and may be safer than oral glucocorticoids in older patients with poorly controlled diabetes, severe osteoporosis, and congestive heart failure. A time-release prednisone formulation has been approved by the US FDA, and the drug can be taken at night to improve morning symptoms in RA patients.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prevention</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A major problem in attempting to prevent RA is identifying those who are at risk of developing the disease in the first place. Although genetic studies provide some clues as to which segment of the population may be at risk, the available information is not precise enough to be of practical use.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conversely, epidemiologic data suggest that smoking is a strong risk factor for RA, as well as more active and difficult to control disease, and developing RA-related interstitial lung disease. Smoking cessation is associated with lower RA disease activity, and may delay or even prevent development of seropositive RA. Along with environmental factors, preclinical anti-CCP positivity is associated higher risk of developing erosive RA, and ongoing studies are examining the early use of DMARDs</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">such as hydroxychloroquine to determine if such approaches will prevent development of the full-blown chronic disease.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Special Issues</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patie nt preference and comorbidity <span class="p">The choice of therapy should be made in conjunction with the patient and the caregivers. Although exercises are important to maintain joint and muscle functions in patients with RA, some older patients are unable to perform regular exercises because of their other medical conditions, or if they have lived an inactive lifestyle for many years and are reluctant to adopt any change. In these situations, emphasizing the positive aspects of exercise (physical, psychological, and social), setting realistic goals, and recommending exercise programs specially tailored for the older population are helpful. In this regard, finding a physical and occupational therapist accustomed to working with older adults is important. Too often the author has seen patients who refuse to return to their therapist because of unrealistic short-term exercise goals.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The importance of assessing a patient’s risk of developing GI, renal, or cardiac complications, and osteoporosis prior to starting NSAIDs and corticosteroids has already been emphasized. Patient preference is important when deciding on a specific DMARD. Older patients with poor eyesight are often reluctant to begin antimalarials out of fear of potential ocular complications, however small the risk may be. These drugs are contraindicated in older patients who cannot be monitored for retinal toxicity, including individuals with macular degeneration or untreated cataract. Older adults who do not want to give up drinking alcohol may choose not to take methotrexate. Some older women have refused to take methotrexate because the drug was part of their breast cancer chemotherapy in the distant past. Intramuscular or subcutaneous methotrexate can be used in older patients who experience dyspepsia or who have difficulty swallowing. Methotrexate and biological response modifiers must be used with extreme caution or not at all in patients with chronic or active infection. Whether older patients with chronic lung disease taking DMARDs should receive</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pneumocystis carinii <span class="p">prophylaxis is unclear. Assessment of the patient’s tuberculosis status should be done prior to beginning anticytokine therapy. The appropriate use of biologics has already been discussed extensively.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older patients on biologic therapies are faced with several important questions about immunization. Older patients with RA should have their</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">immunization history thoroughly reviewed, and ideally have received all the appropriate immunizations prior to receiving DMARDs and biologic therapies (particularly rituximab). Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines should be given as they are in the general population. Short-term discontinuation of methotrexate for 2 weeks after influenza vaccination may improve vaccine response without significant increase in RA disease activity or transient risk of arthritis flare. Those who have not received the pneumococcal 13-valent vaccine (Prevnar 13) should receive the vaccination. The use of tetanus toxoid should be as per normal guidelines except for patients who have received rituximab within the previous 24 weeks, when passive immunization with tetanus immunoglobulin is recommended. Current recommendation is against the use of live vaccines in patients on biologic therapies. However, two studies suggest that RA patients on biologics may be safely vaccinated with the attenuated live herpes zoster vaccine, particularly if their disease is under good control. In recent years, a recombinant zoster vaccine was approved by the FDA offering a safer option for biologics-exposed patients. High rheumatoid disease activity and the use of biologics, prednisone, or hydroxycholoroquine are all risk factors for zoster in RA patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">One study examined the influence of comorbidities on clinical outcomes of over 1500 DAMRD/biologics-treated RA patients in the CORRONA registry. As expected, older patients have more comorbidities than the younger cohort. Although disease activity measures at entry to the registry were similar across age categories, older patients have less improvement in their disease and functional measures over time, and were less likely to attain remission at follow-up. Importantly, the age difference can be largely accounted for by the number of comorbidities in the older patient population.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Care se ttings <span class="p">The physician’s choice of therapy has to take into account the patient’s overall state of health and mobility, and the care setting. In most cases, home laboratory monitoring for DMARD toxicity can be arranged for patients with significant mobility problems. Instead of DMARDs, the use of corticosteroids (oral, intra-articular, or parenteral; low- or high-dose “pulse” treatment) may be a good option in patients with RA with active disease in the end stages of their lives. Therapeutic goals may also be different in a patient near the end of life, when either long-term treatment outcome or side effects may not be important considerations. An example is a patient with RA who has end-stage dementia, when judicious use of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">corticosteroid rather than high-dose immunosuppression for active disease may be more appropriate. Biologic therapies achieve their therapeutic effect much sooner than DMARDs, such as methotrexate, and may therefore be a reasonable choice in DMARD-naïve patients whose disease is not controlled by corticosteroids and who are near the end of life.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects the female population. The incidence of lupus has been increasing with an estimated quarter of a million patients now with the disease in the United States. Late-onset lupus (LOL) is defined as symptoms beginning after the age of 55, representing approximately 10% of all cases of lupus. However, the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database (a population database covering 5% of the United Kingdom) has surprising data that the peak incidence of lupus in women occurs at age 50 to 54 years and for men it is 70 to 74 years. Improved therapies and greater appreciation of the importance of treating comorbid conditions such as coronary artery disease have resulted in more patients with lupus surviving into old age. An ongoing CDC–sponsored study in Southeast Michigan in the United Sates showed that there are substantial racial disparities in the burden of SLE, with Black patients experiencing earlier age at diagnosis and a twofold increase in SLE incidence and prevalence compared to White (<span class="s1">Figure 101-4</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 101-4. </span>Age-specific annual incidence (<b>A</b>) and prevalence (<b>B</b>) rates (per 100,000 persons) of systemic lupus erythematosus in southeastern Michigan, United States, 2002–2004 (Reproduced with permission from Somers EC, Thomas SL, Smeeth L, et al.

The 1982 ACR Classification Criteria for SLE were revised to include the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. And the most recent 2019 EULAR/ACR Classification Criteria for SLE use ANA as an entry criterion and include noninfectious fever (<span class="s1">Table 101-7</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These criteria were designed for research purposes and have not been validated in LOL. Low-titer ANA may be present in up to one-third of older adults. Positive ANAs (titer ≥ 1:80) have high sensitivity but poor specificity for SLE when measured by indirect immunofluorescence using the standard Hep-2 substrate. In contrast, the presence of anti-dsDNA (double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid) or anti-Sm (Smith) antibodies is highly specific for SLE. However, these antibodies are only detected in 31% to 86% and 0% to 24% of patients with LOL, respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 101-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>2019 EULAR/ACR CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathogenesis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cause of SLE is unknown. The concordance rate of SLE in monozygotic twins is between 25% and 50%, suggesting that genetic and environmental factors are both important. Hormonal factors are important in the pathogenesis of SLE as the disease often affects women of childbearing age. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, an inciting role for microbial</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">organisms has been postulated but not proven. Human SLE is a polygenic disease. At least 50 susceptibility or resistance loci have been identified in human and murine lupus (eg, <i>sle</i>1, 2, 3). A defect or deficiency in gene product(s) regulating immune complex clearance, such as in some cases of inherited complement (C1, C4, and C2) deficiencies, is associated with a high likelihood of the development of SLE. Variability in the Fc<i>γ </i>receptor alleles is believed to play a role in determining the susceptibility to SLE in some racial and ethnic populations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition to changes in the adaptive arm of the immune system, there is a pathogenic role for aberrant innate immune responses in lupus. Immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and other myeloid cells all participate in both the adaptive and innate arms of immune responses.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Interferon alpha, a key mediator of innate immunity, may also be important in lupus pathogenesis. A Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling defect may be important in sustaining the inflammatory response in this disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It is not clear whether LOL is a different disease from younger onset lupus. Many older adults have a low level of circulating autoantibodies. Additionally, measures of various markers of immunosenescence suggest that patients with autoimmune diseases have accelerated aging of the immune system. Given the apparent high incidence of lupus in middle-aged and late life, a better understanding of how immune senescence can affect the normally tightly regulated process that prevents the development of autoimmunity is needed. One hypothesis is that defective T-cell activation in aging may result in a suboptimal immune response to foreign antigen, which, in turn, may allow these cells to cross-react with self-antigens. Secondly, thymic involution and the accumulation of memory T cells in aging may “force” the proliferation of naïve T cells with high affinity for self-antigen.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thirdly, epigenetics, which refers to the regulation of gene expression through cellular processes including DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA interference, is affected by aging. Both DNA methylation and histone acetylation are important mechanisms for the development of lupus and potentially other autoimmune diseases. Whether the age-dependent epigenetic changes also affect genes that are important in the development of autoimmunity in aging is unknown. Finally, it has been postulated that age- related DNA methylation changes may “reawaken” X-chromosome genes that have previously been inactivated in females. This, in turn, may help to explain the gender differences in lupus in the older adult population.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because of the lack of awareness of this disease in older people, the average time it takes from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of LOL is long, averaging between 2 and 3 years. The female to male ratio of LOL is approximately 4:1, much lower than the 9:1 ratio in the younger age group.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The high prevalence of SLE in younger African-Americans is not so apparent in LOL. However, whether this merely reflects the demographics of the study locations is unclear.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The clinical features of patients with LOL are quite different from those of patients who develop lupus at a younger age (<span class="s1">Table 101-8</span>). The patients with LOL tend to have a milder disease and are less likely to develop alopecia, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral/nasal ulceration, glomerulonephritis, and lymphadenopathy. Patients with LOL may be more prone to develop cytopenias, serositis, and interstitial pneumonitis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Interestingly, the incidence of cancer, with the exception of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, may be lower in LOL than in younger patients with lupus. The cause of death in patients with LOL is usually related to complications of treatment such as infections, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 101-8 <span class="s3">■ </span>THE FREQUENCY OF SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF LATE-ONSET SLE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The choice of therapy is largely dictated by the specific disease manifestations. Antimalarials (see above) are useful for many lupus symptoms including arthritis, serositis, mucositis, and skin disease. Available evidence strongly supports the long-term use of antimalarials in patients with lupus. Quinacrine, available from many compounding pharmacists, does not cause retinal damage and may be used in older patients who cannot take potentially retinotoxic drugs. NSAIDs are used by the majority of patients with lupus for symptomatic relief of arthralgia, myalgia, serositis, fever, and headaches. Their use in older patients must be weighed against their potential side effects. NSAIDs are best avoided in patients with lupus having renal involvement.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Local corticosteroid treatments such as (short-term) topical or intradermal injections can be helpful in cutaneous lupus. Systemic steroids are often reserved for more severe diseases such as lupus pneumonitis, carditis, hemolytic anemia, or new-onset renal disease. Intravenous “pulse” methylprednisolone in doses of 1 g/day for up to 3 consecutive days can be lifesaving in rapidly progressive or fulminant disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The use of cytotoxic drugs such as cyclophosphamide has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality associated with lupus nephritis. Monthly intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide is generally well tolerated and has fewer side effects than daily oral administration of the drug. Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab may be used in lupus patients with renal disease who are unable to tolerate high-dose corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide. Cytotoxics should not be withheld from older patients with lupus who have major organ involvement. The use of alkylating agents is associated with an increased risk of future cancer development. However, this may be a more important consideration in younger patients with a longer life expectancy. Gonadal toxicity is not a very important issue in the older adult population.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There has been an explosion of interest in clinical treatment trials of newer drugs in lupus. Promising preliminary data include drugs that target the interferon pathway, including anifrolumab. In 2011, belimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits soluble B-lymphocyte activating factor (BAFF), became the first lupus drug in its class to receive US FDA approval and its indication was expanded to include the treatment of active lupus nephritis in 2021. Vovlosporin, an oral calcineurin inhibitor, in combination</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with other background immunosuppression, has recently been approved by the FDA for adult patients with active lupus nephritis but the role in older lupus patients remained untested.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SJÖGREN SYNDROME</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sjögren syndrome is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by progressive lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration of the exocrine glands, leading to dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). The syndrome can occur in isolation (primary) or in association with other autoimmune diseases (secondary) such as RA, SLE, or polymyositis. In addition to the sicca symptoms (dry eyes and dry mouth), serologic evidence of autoimmunity and objective assessment of oral and ocular involvement need to be documented before the diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome is made. The Schirmer test, in which a strip of Whatman No. 41 filter paper is placed in the lower conjunctival sac, is considered positive if less than 5 mm of the paper is wet after 5 minutes. Ocular involvement can also be documented by staining the conjunctiva with 1% Rose Bengal stain and slit-lamp eye examination. Minor salivary gland biopsy is the most commonly performed test used in diagnosing salivary gland involvement in Sjögren syndrome. The test is considered positive when there is more than one focus (aggregate of ≥ 50 lymphocytes) per 4</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mm<span class="s22">2</span> of biopsy specimen. Biopsy of the parotid, rather than of a minor salivary gland, should be done in patients complaining of parotid gland swelling. Saliva production is measured after overnight fasting without oral stimulation (brushing of teeth, smoking, etc). A normal person should produce at least 1.5 mL of saliva in 15 minutes. Parotid sialography and salivary gland scintigraphy are alternate procedures for documenting salivary gland involvement.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epidemiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Depending on the definition and the age of the population studied, the prevalence of Sjögren syndrome has been estimated to be between 0.04% and 4.8%, making it the second commonest autoimmune disease after RA. The disease is likely underdiagnosed as patients often fail to discuss their symptoms with their physicians or believe that the symptoms are part of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">inevitable consequence of aging. One study on a geriatric population suggests that subclinical disease may occur in up to 3% of the nursing home population. Although the prevalence of sicca symptoms increases with age, the peak incidence of primary Sjögren syndrome occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life, with a 9:1 female:male ratio.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathogenesis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most cases of Sjögren syndrome occur sporadically, although there are examples of familial aggregation. An association with HLA antigens has been reported, including HLA-DR3, HLA-DR2, and HLADRw52 in White populations. In addition, HLA-DR3 and HLADQw2.1 are linked to the development of anti-Ro antibodies. Like most other autoimmune diseases, an environmental or viral trigger has been proposed for Sjögren syndrome. One theory suggests that autoimmune lymphocytes are “homed” to salivary and lacrimal glands. This is followed by clonal expansion of the autoreactive cells in the glands, upregulation of major histocompatibility complex and adhesion molecules by epithelial cells, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Defective apoptosis causing the failure to delete autoreactive cells has been proposed as a central mechanism explaining the lymphoid aggregates seen in the exocrine glands. α-Fodrin, a cytoskeletal protein, was recently identified as a candidate autoantigen in Sjögren syndrome. Interestingly, neonatal immunization with</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">this antigen can prevent the development of the disease in an animal model of Sjögren syndrome.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation and Clinical Features</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most patients with Sjögren syndrome have a slowly progressive and benign course. The onset of the disease is insidious, and it may take up to 10 years for the full-blown disease to develop. Older patients with Sjögren syndrome usually present with sicca symptoms. They may complain of difficulty chewing and swallowing dry foods, the frequent need to drink liquid especially at night, difficulty wearing dentures, abnormal taste, sore/burning sensation in the mouth, and intolerance to spicy foods. Xerostomia also predisposes these patients to dental decay and the development of oral candidiasis. Instead of the classical white candida plaque, patients with Sjögren syndrome may have erythematous oral candidiasis. In addition to the feeling of dryness in the eyes, patients with ocular involvement may</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">complain of an itching or burning sensation, the feeling that there is a foreign body in the eye, and photosensitivity. Unilateral or bilateral parotid gland swelling occurs in one-third of all patients with primary Sjögren syndrome and is more commonly seen in the younger age group. The differential diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral parotid gland swelling includes viral (including HIV-1) and bacterial infections, sarcoidosis, salivary gland ductal obstruction, and neoplasm. Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is increasingly being recognized to have clinical features that overlap with Sjögren syndrome. This heterogeneous collection of disorders shares features of tumor-like swelling of involved organs such as salivary and parotid glands, a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate of IgG4-positive plasma cells, and elevated serum IgG4 levels in 60% to 70% of affected patients. This disease should be considered in patients with sicca symptoms but who have negative autoantibodies.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Approximately 60% of patients with Sjögren syndrome develop extraglandular disease (<span class="s1">Table 101-9</span>). Nonerosive arthritis/arthralgia is the commonest extraglandular manifestation and may precede sicca symptoms. Any part of the pulmonary tree from the trachea to the pleural lining may be involved, causing cough, hoarseness, and shortness of breath.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pseudolymphoma and lymphoma should be suspected when an unexplained pulmonary nodule or lymphadenopathy is seen on chest radiograph. Patients with Sjögren syndrome may experience dysphagia because of dryness of the oral pharynx or abnormal esophageal motility. Chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric lymphoma, vitamin B<span class="s11">12</span> deficiency, and antibodies to parietal cells</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">have all been described in this disease. Autoimmune thyroid disease is present in 13% to 45% of patients with Sjögren syndrome. Patients with Sjögren syndrome often have an elevated liver enzyme profile, especially if antimitochondrial antibodies are present. Interestingly, sicca symptoms are present in 50% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Renal disease occurs in approximately 10% of patients with Sjögren syndrome.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lymphocytic infiltration and immune complex deposition, proximal renal tubular acidosis with Fanconi syndrome, renal stones, electrolyte imbalance, and cryoglobulinemia have all been reported.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 101-9 <span class="s3">■ </span>EXTRAGLANDULAR MANIFESTATIONS OF SJÖGREN SYNDROME</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The association of RA and Sjögren syndrome was first described by Henrik Sjögren in 1933. Although it is believed that RA is the commonest cause of secondary Sjögren syndrome, its true prevalence in RA is unknown. Patients with secondary Sjögren syndrome have milder disease with primarily sicca symptoms (dry eyes and dry mouth). Systemic complications such as salivary gland swelling, central nervous system disease, renal disease (interstitial nephritis or glomerulonephritis), and lymphoproliferative disease are uncommon.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with Sjögren syndrome often have polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, as well as selective increased production of specific autoantibodies. ANA and RFs are present in more than 75% and 66% of patients with Sjögren syndrome, respectively. Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are detected in 70% and 40% of the affected patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Interestingly, anti-La antibodies are less common in the secondary form of the disease.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Simple lifestyle changes such as air humidification and avoidance of cigarette smoke are helpful. Nasal dryness can be treated with saline drops or gel. Vaginal dryness can be reduced using water-soluble lubricants and estrogen cream. Dry skin can be improved by using moisturizers and bath oil. Lipstick and lip balm can be used to reduce lip dryness. Meticulous oral hygiene and frequent dental visits are important to prevent dental decay and oral candidiasis. Frequent fluid replacement, topical fluoride treatment, the use of non–alcohol-based or water-soluble vitamin-based mouthwash, and sugarfree chewing gum can all be helpful. Unfortunately, artificial saliva substitutes that are currently available are not very helpful. Oral candidiasis can be treated with a prolonged course (1–4 months) of a noncariogenic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">antifungal drug (eg, nystatin vaginal tablets 100,000 units two to three times a day), with separate treatment of dentures.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The mainstay of treatment for dry eye remains artificial tears.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Preparations now available can penetrate into the epithelial cell layer, extending duration of action. However, these may occasionally cause blurring and leave residue on eye lashes. Because patients with Sjögren syndrome generally require long-term tear replenishment, preservative-free artificial tears should be used. Topical low-dose cyclosporine can be used for Sjögren eye disease. Tear drainage can also be reduced by the placement of occlusive elements (eg, silicon implants) in the puncta or permanently by laser or thermal cautery. Soft contact lenses may be used to protect the cornea, especially in the presence of keratitis filamentosa. Because the contact lenses require wetting, the patient needs to be careful not to introduce infection to the eyes. Plastic wrap or swimming goggles can be used at night to reduce tear evaporation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Whenever possible, drugs with significant cholinergic side effects should be discontinued. Muscarinic agonists (pilocarpine and cevimeline) may be helpful in alleviating dry mouth symptoms in patients with Sjögren syndrome. In 2016, the Sjögren’s Syndrome Foundation provided clinical practice guidelines on the use of biologic agents. Anti-TNFs are not recommended to treat sicca symptoms in primary Sjögren syndrome. For musculoskeletal symptoms, hydroxychloroquine should be considered first line, and if ineffective, methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and corticosteroids can be prescribed. For extraglandular disease, azathioprine may be more beneficial than leflunomide or sulfasalazine, and Rituximab may be considered for severe systemic manifestations such as interstitial pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, and vasculitis. Unfortunately, while treatments are helpful for symptomatic relief, the destruction of exocrine gland continues despite best current effort.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DRUG-INDUCED RHEUMATIC SYNDROMES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Polypharmacy and iatrogenic diseases are important geriatric issues. Medications are also increasingly recognized as common causes of rheumatic syndromes. These can be broadly categorized into drug-induced lupus (DIL), drug-induced myopathy/myositis, and drug-induced vasculitis. Drug-induced myopathy/myositis will be discussed in detail in the myopathy chapter.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drug-Induced Lupus</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More than 100 drugs have now been implicated in DIL (<span class="s1">Table 101-10</span>), although a much smaller number have a strong association. The average age of onset is between 50 and 70 years. However, specific criteria for the diagnosis of DIL have not been established. Compared to the idiopathic disease, patients with “classical” DIL have a milder illness and a more restricted autoantibody profile. Antihistone antibodies are present in high frequencies in DIL associated with drugs such as procainamide or hydralazine but are not as frequently seen in patients with drugs such as minocycline or anti-TNF agents. The incidence of DIL has been estimated to be approximately 15,000 to 20,000 per year, with between 30,000 and 50,000 patients currently affected in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 101-10 <span class="s3">■ </span>DRUGS IMPLICATED IN DRUG-INDUCED LUPUS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Procainamide (procainamide-induced lupus, PIL) and hydralazine (hydralazine-induced lupus, HIL) are drugs historically associated with DIL and are well-defined DIL models. Patients with DIL are usually older and more likely to be men, reflecting the age and sex of the population receiving these drugs. One-third of patients receiving procainamide for more than a year will develop symptoms, and almost all will become ANA-positive after 2 years. In contrast, fewer than 20% of hydralazine-treated patients will develop DIL. The risk for developing HIL is dose-dependent and is highest in patients taking more than 200 mg/day and in those who have taken more</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">than 100 g cumulative dose. Compared to patients with idiopathic lupus, patients with PIL and HIL have fewer renal, neuropsychiatric, and skin manifestations. Pleuropulmonary complaints are particularly common in PIL, while immune cytopenias are uncommon in DIL in general. By definition, all patients with DIL are ANA-positive (mostly homogenous pattern). More than 90% of patients with PIL and HIL have antihistone antibodies, and 20% to 40% are RF-positive.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Up to 19% of patients treated with IFN-α develop some form of autoimmunity. Approximately 12% of patients receiving this drug develop positive ANA, and between 0.15% and 0.7% will develop a lupus-like illness. Anti-dsDNA antibodies occur in 8%, and almost all the patients with IFN-α-induced lupus have elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies. The development of autoimmunity appears to be dependent on the dose and duration of treatment. Other rheumatic syndromes associated with IFN-α include RA, polymyositis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter syndrome, and sarcoidosis. Autoimmune thyroid diseases are common following IFN-α treatment. It is important to differentiate this from idiopathic hypothyroidism that is prevalent in the older adult population.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients receiving TNF antagonists often develop serologic evidence of autoimmunity. In one study, new ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies were found in 33% and 9% of infliximab recipients, respectively. However, there is clear discordance between the development of autoantibodies and clinical autoimmunity, with only a handful of symptomatic patients reported, mostly with skin diseases. Approximately 13% of patients exposed to infliximab develop infliximab-specific antibodies. Patients receiving concurrent immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or azathioprine are less likely to develop these antibodies. The presence of antibodies to infliximab increases the likelihood of an infusion reaction but does not predict the development of autoantibodies or DIL.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RHEUMATIC SYNDROMES AND CANCER</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinicians are often concerned that a patient’s rheumatic complaints may represent the early systemic presentation of an occult tumor. Patients with autoimmune diseases are also at higher risk of developing cancers. Many cancer therapies are complicated by rheumatologic side effects. Finally, immunosuppressive therapies used for treating autoimmune diseases may predispose the patients to malignancies.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Musculoskeletal Symptoms Associated with Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the mechanisms for paraneoplastic rheumatologic complications are often poorly understood, many are believed to be endocrine or immune- mediated. An extensive search for an occult malignancy is not recommended in patients with most rheumatic syndromes unless there are specific symptoms or findings suggesting the possible presence of a tumor.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, the possibility of metastatic disease should be considered in an older patient presenting with severe pain in or around a joint. Metastatic joint disease caused by lung or breast cancer is usually monoarticular or oligoarticular (two to five joints). Pain and synovitis are caused by synovial inflammation in response to tumor cells in and around the joint. Large joints (eg, knee and hip) are most commonly affected. However, asymmetric polyarthritis can occur at the late stages of cancer. The vertebral column is a common place for metastatic disease. A malignancy work-up should be done if an older patient presents with intractable or nocturnal back pain that is increasing in severity and if the patient has constitutional symptoms such as fever or weight loss. Multiple myeloma frequently causes lytic lesions and pathologic fractures. Light-chain amyloidosis occurs in 15% of these patients and is associated with a symmetric small-joint arthropathy. In addition, amyloid infiltration in the shoulder joint produces the classical “shoulder</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pad sign.” Hyperuricemia and gout may develop in patients with large tumor bulk, especially during chemotherapy. Raynaud phenomenon with or without panniculitis in older adults has been described in occult malignancy including cutaneous manifestations of myeloma.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is the most common rheumatic syndrome associated with malignancy and is almost always caused by metastatic lung cancer in the Western world. Ankles, wrists, knees, and fingers are the sites most frequently affected. The cause is unknown, but a neurally mediated mechanism is suggested by improvement with vagotomy and atropine.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carcinomatous polyarthritis can precede or follow the diagnosis of the underlying cancer, most commonly breast in women and lung in men. The classical description is an acute-onset asymmetric seronegative polyarthritis in an older patient that resembles LORA. The arthritis often improves with cancer therapy and may relapse with tumor recurrence. A polymyalgia rheumatica-like disease has been linked to metastatic cancer. This is suggested by a younger age of onset, prominent constitutional symptoms, asymmetric involvement of proximal muscle groups, a relatively low</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sedimentation rate, and an incomplete response to prednisone. The Lambert- Eaton syndrome is characterized by an antibody-mediated defect in acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. It is most commonly associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung. Ptosis, distal muscle involvement, and characteristic electromyogram findings distinguish the disease from common inflammatory myopathies. Bilateral palmar fasciitis with or without polyarthritis is associated with gynecologic tumors, in particular, ovarian carcinoma. This is usually associated with late metastatic disease and carries a poor prognosis. Panniculitis with synovitis and serositis is a well-known accompaniment of pancreatic cancer. POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-[monoclonal] protein, and skin abnormalities) is associated with plasma cell dyscrasias, including multiple myeloma. Finally, there are sporadic reports of steroid- resistant eosinophilic fasciitis associated with hematologic malignancies.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rheumatic Diseases and Cancer</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with autoimmune diseases are at an increased risk of the development of a variety of malignancies. This tendency may be exacerbated by the use of specific immunosuppressive drugs. Patients with RA have a two- to fivefold increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The risk is even higher if secondary Sjögren syndrome or a serum paraprotein is present. An increased risk for oral-pharyngeal cancers has been described in geographic locations where these tumors are prevalent. Interestingly, patients with RA may be at a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer. Whether the lower risk is related to the regular use of NSAIDs in this population is unknown. Patients with Sjögren syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop lymphoma than are age-, sex-, and race-matched normal subjects. The risk may be higher if the patient is anti-Ro or anti-La positive. In some of these patients, there appears to be a progression from benign exocrinopathy to pseudolymphoma to lymphoma. These tumors are almost exclusively B-cell lymphomas with a high frequency of a t(14;18) chromosomal translocation. The malignant transformation is likely the result of chronic B-cell stimulation. The presence of a monoclonal IgM spike on serum protein electrophoresis may herald the transformation to malignant lymphoma. Hypogammaglobulinemia and loss of autoantibodies may eventually occur when the lymphoma cells replace the normal antibody-producing plasma cells.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with polymyositis have a twofold increased risk of developing cancer, particularly in the 1 to 5 years following the diagnosis of the muscle disease. The risk of cancer in patients with dermatomyositis is much higher (four to five times), and the cancer may be discovered years before or after the muscle disease is diagnosed. Older age, the presence of digital vasculitis, and normal serum creatinine kinase levels have all been cited as possible risk factors for cancer development in patients with inflammatory myositis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with overlap syndromes and those with myositis-specific antibodies do not appear to have a higher incidence of cancer than other patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis. The cancers associated with inflammatory myositis are those that are commonly seen, including breast, lung, gynecologic, and GI malignancies. Interestingly, nasopharyngeal carcinomas are the dominant cancers associated with myositis in countries that have a high prevalence of these malignancies.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It is controversial whether patients with other autoimmune diseases are more likely to develop cancer. Some reports have described an increased risk of lymphoma (particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and possibly lung, breast, and cervical cancers in patients with SLE. Patients with scleroderma may be predisposed to skin cancer, and patients with systemic sclerosis who have pulmonary fibrosis are at risk of developing lung cancer.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk of Cancer with Immunosuppression</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with RA treated with methotrexate may be at increased risk of developing cancer and lymphoma. The actual risk is unclear, however, because the relative risk has been compared to that of the general population. Nevertheless, there are a large number of case reports or case series linking the occurrence of lymphoma (mostly diffuse large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas) in patients with RA receiving low-dose weekly methotrexate. In most cases, cessation of therapy is associated with complete regression of the lymphoid cancer, suggesting a causative relationship. DNA analysis shows that approximately 50% of these lymphomas harbored the Epstein- Barr virus genome. It is, therefore, possible that the drug regimen may promote the malignant transformation of normal lymphoid tissue by the oncogenic virus. Patients with RA on azathioprine and cyclosporin A have a twofold increased risk of lymphoma relative to control patients with RA. A real association between the use of immunosuppressive therapy and the development of lymphoproliferative disorders also occurs with organ</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">transplantation. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is 50-fold greater in patients with renal transplant, especially if they receive cyclosporin A as part of their immunosuppressive regimen.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The issue of cancer risk in patients on anti-TNF agents has already been discussed. Early results from a safety clinical trial comparing tofacitinib and anti-TNF agents suggest there may be increased risk of cancer associated with the JAK inhibitor. Cyclophosphamide is commonly used to treat severe lupus manifestations, including nephritis and cerebritis. Patients with lupus on cyclophosphamide are more likely to develop bladder cancer, lymphoma (primarily non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and possibly skin cancer.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemotherapy-Associated Rheumatologic Complications</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As many as half of women receiving aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer experience subjective joint achiness or pain, but these symptoms rarely translate to frank arthritis. Taxanes (eg, paclitaxel and docetaxel) are used for many breast and gynecologic cancers, as well as for HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma. These drugs may cause myalgias and arthralgias, as well as skin rashes with histologic features of subacute cutaneous lupus. Rapid cell turnover from chemotherapy, particularly in cases of lympho- and myelo- proliferative malignancies, can result in an acute gout attack if the patients are not given adequate prophylactic treatment. Bisphosphonates are increasingly used as part of chemotherapeutic regimens in metastatic bone disease, and their use is associated with a number of musculoskeletal complications including complications of hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical femur fractures. Bleomycin use has been linked to Raynaud phenomenon and scleroderma-like skin diseases.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as CRLA- 4/PD-1 inhibitors and anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monotherapy have been increasingly utilized to treat malignancies. The use of ICIs is associated with immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), and a wide spectrum of rheumatic manifestations including arthralgia/arthritis, myalgia/myositis, polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren’s syndrome, lupus and vasculitis have been reported. In addition, ICIs may exacerbate underlying rheumatic diseases. Rheumatic-IRAEs should be recognized early and the approach to management should be transdisciplinary in conjunction with oncology. The musculoskeletal side effects may be transient and regress after stopping ICIs. Corticosteroids are most commonly used to treat rheumatic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">spectrum IRAEs and, if unresponsive, immunosuppressive medications such as hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, TNF-inhibitors and anti-IL-6 are preferred treatments.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COVID-19 AND RHEUMATIC DISEASES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. COVID-19 is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols and have an incubation period exceeding 14 days. Although most recover from COVID-19, some experience severe disease and complications including acute respiratory failure, shock, multiorgan dysfunction, and thromboembolic events. There was concern from the outset whether patients with rheumatic disease, and especially those receiving immunotherapy, may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Several registries including the Global Rheumatology Alliance were established to track the impact of COVID-19 on rheumatic disease patients. Early epidemiologic data suggest multimorbidity, older age, and high doses of glucocorticoid may be associated with more frequent hospitalization and worse outcomes among patients with rheumatic diseases. Based on limited available data, the ACR recommends caution with initiation of new biologic therapy and continued use of established immunosuppressive therapy for patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Early in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine garnered international attention and controversy for their potential role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 given in vitro inhibition of severe SARS-CoV-2. A national drug shortage ensued, limiting the availability of drugs for patients reliant on these medications for treatment of many rheumatic conditions. Then, multiple rigorous studies showed no benefit of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis or COVID-19 treatment. Subsequently in June 2020, the FDA revoked emergency use authorization (EUA) on the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in certain hospitalized patients. Another immunosuppressive medication tocilizumab emerged as a potential alternative treatment for COVID-19 after early observational data from China showed increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients with elevated IL-6 levels. In addition, nonrandomized trials suggested possible benefit in the treatment of cytokine storms from severe COVID-19 and off-label use of tocilizumab was for a time considered</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">standard of care in the United States. In February 2021, the National Institutes of Health and Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended against the use of tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 except in clinical trials after preliminary results from several randomized studies including the largest of its kind, the Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP), showed insufficient data to support its use in hospitalized patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A number of COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, and as of early 2022, two nonlive mRNA COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna and one viral-vector vaccine developed by Johnson and Johnson (JJ) are FDA authorized for use in the United States. A rare but serious syndrome of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia has been reported at an incidence of 1 in 7 million with the JJ vaccine, as has been reported with another viral-vector AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe. The ACR recommends patients with rheumatic diseases to receive and be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination as they are at higher risk for hospitalization for COVID-19 and worse outcomes compared to the general population. Either of the mRNA vaccines is recommended over the J&amp;J vaccine for patients with rheumatic diseases, and immunosuppressed patients who previously completed the 2- dose mRNA series should receive an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose at least 28 days after the completion of the primary vaccine series. Increasingly studies are showing immunosuppressed patients have lower response rates to available COVID-19 vaccines, and the ACR provided clinical guidance on immunomodulatory medication use and timing of COVID-19 vaccination to optimize vaccine response as outlined in <span class="s1">Table 101-11</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 101-11 <span class="s3">■ </span>USE AND TIMING OF COVID-19 VACCINATION IN RMD PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism Collaborative Initiative. <i>Arthritis Rheum</i>. 2010;62:2569–2581.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">American College of Rheumatology COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Guidance Summary for Patients with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Disease (updated April 28, 2021), <a href="http://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/COVID-19-Vaccine-" class="a" target="_blank">https://</a><span style=" color: #0000ED;">www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/COVID-19-Vaccine- Clinical-Guidance-Rheumatic-Diseases-Summary.pdf</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Cappelli LC, Gutierrez AK, Bingham CO, et al.

Prevalence estimates range from 27% to 86% depending on the population evaluated, the study design, and criteria employed to identify back pain. One study conducted in Israel found that 44% of 70-year-olds and 58% of 77-year-olds reported back pain. In the Framingham Heart Study cohort (ages 68–100), 22% of participants reported back pain on most days. As the second most common reason for visiting a physician, annual all-cause medical costs related to back pain exceeded</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$350 billion and are expected to rise as the population continues to age. Over the past decade, health care–related spending on low back pain diagnostic and “therapeutic” procedures has skyrocketed, yet patient outcomes (in all age groups) have not improved.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A longitudinal study demonstrated that older adults are more likely to develop recurrent episodes of back pain if they are female, suffer from depressive symptoms, have two or more chronic conditions, or self-report arthritis. Back pain in older adults is associated with dependence in activities of daily living, mobility impairment, and poor self-reported health. The association of back pain and physical function has been quantified; the number of months with back pain (resulting in restricted activity) is associated with such markers of frailty as gait speed, chair stands, and foot tap performance. In a study of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older, back pain was second only to shortness of breath while climbing stairs in its association with impaired general physical health status. Cross-sectional data from the Framingham Heart Study have shown that back symptoms</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">account for a large percentage of functional limitations in older adults, especially in women. Psychosocial factors, including comorbid depression or anxiety as well as pain-related fear avoidance and pain catastrophizing, play an important role in the experience/reporting of back pain and potentially mediate the relationship with subsequent disability.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While low back pain is a common problem in older adults, its etiology, natural history, and methods for effective management are not fully understood nor well defined.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><ul id="l75"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Review the epidemiology of back pain in older adults, including associated psychosocial factors.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Understand how back pain is classified and review its clinical course.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Recognize the broad differential of back pain etiology in older adults.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Understand the value of history, physical examination, and observation when evaluating an older adult with back pain and the indications for imaging in this population.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><ol id="l76"><li data-list-text="1."><h3 style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Back pain is one of the most common complaints among older adults leading to considerable morbidity and cost.</h3></li><li data-list-text="2."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic and therapeutic costs have increased;

4 weeks), subacute (lasts between 4 and 12 weeks), or chronic (lasting &gt; 3 months; some definitions require &gt; 6 months). While much of the literature evaluates chronic symptoms, research shows that low back pain is <i>not </i>likely constant, but rather, recurrent or episodic. Understanding the various patterns of back pain in older adults, including what precipitates recurrent episodes, is important as prevention and treatment planning may differ.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ETIOLOGY/PRESENTATION OF BACK PAIN</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A number of discrete conditions manifest as back pain in older adults (<span class="s1">Table 102-1</span>). These conditions include mechanical causes, lumbar spinal stenosis, sciatica, osteoarthritis of the hip, vertebral compression fractures, osteoporotic sacral fractures, tumors, and infections. Systemic conditions such as malignancy and infections, although rarely the cause of back pain, are</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">more common in older compared to younger age groups. One of the most challenging aspects of assessing and managing back pain is identifying the source(s) of pain in the older adult who often has multiple musculoskeletal comorbidities (eg, trochanteric bursitis, hip osteoarthritis, multilevel lumbar degenerative changes and lumbar stenosis). These conditions rarely occur in isolation, and pinpointing which one contributes most to the patient’s pain may be difficult but is vital.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 102-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES FOR BACK PAIN IN OLDER ADULTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The vast majority of low back pain seen in primary care settings is labeled “nonspecific low back pain” as there is no specific attributable disease or spinal pathology. The natural history, associated features, and etiology of back pain in older adults remain poorly characterized.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assessment of back pain in older adults includes evaluation of the historical, physical, and diagnostic imaging features of the affected patients for the conditions listed below, and then to make a diagnosis of nonspecific low back pain after these conditions have been ruled out.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tumor</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The clinician must always be alert to nonmechanical, either referred or systemic, causes of low back pain. Visceral causes of back pain, such as abdominal aortic aneurysms or pancreatic cancer, are usually nonpositional, progressive, and associated with a normal examination of the lumbar spine and hip. Older adults with spinal column tumors often believe that their pain is temporally related to an event or trauma in the recent past. This usually indicates a pathological fracture which occurs as a result of minor trauma.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, acute onset of pain that starts in the absence of recent trauma should also be considered a possible pathological fracture. Tumors usually present with a gradual onset and progressive course, usually worse at night with persistent worsening of the pain over weeks and months. Additionally, tumor pain is often nonpositional, lasts longer than 4 weeks, and is associated with systemic/constitutional symptoms. The pain associated with spinal column tumors can occur for several reasons. Vertebral column tumors cause bone remodeling, thinning of the cortical rim which leads to pathological fractures. In the early stages of the disease, the stretched periosteum is the cause of pain; however, after development of the pathological fracture, pain secondary to neural compression, radiculopathy, and instability (micromotion) predominates.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Infection</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although a rare cause of back pain, vertebral and disc infections can be difficult to distinguish from a mechanical cause of back pain; disc infections can cause the same abrupt onset, positional changes, and L4, L5 and L5, S1 neurologic abnormalities seen in mechanical disc disease. Unremitting back pain not relieved by rest is the most common presenting complaint. Back pain is the most common musculoskeletal complaint reported by patients with endocarditis, due to metastatic infection (abscess or septic emboli). Because the disc is often involved in this condition, the signs and symptoms can mimic mechanical disc disease. Pain may be accompanied by other constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss, fever or poor appetite; fever</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">can be absent in older patients with infection. The clinician must be alert to a possible infectious cause of back pain for patients with a high risk of endovascular infection (artificial heart valves, indwelling venous catheters, intravenous drug abuse, etc) and in patients with systemic symptoms and signs of inflammation. When osteomyelitis or discitis is discovered, it is imperative to image the entire neural axis with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with and without contrast of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, to rule out tandem, noncontiguous areas of infection.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vertebral Compression Fractures</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The abrupt onset of severe back pain, especially in a patient with risk factors for osteoporosis, with or without a history of falls, should always call for a spinal x-ray to rule out a vertebral compression fracture (<span class="s1">Table 102-2</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vertebral compression fracture is the most common type of osteoporotic fracture. Those that occur slowly (especially in the mid and upper thoracic spine) are often asymptomatic. Only approximately 30% to 40% of all vertebral compression fractures are symptomatic. Most symptomatic fractures are in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. Height loss and kyphosis should heighten suspicion for the presence of a vertebral fracture.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 102-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>CHARACTERISTICS OF VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">At times, the initial x-ray is normal and the changes of vertebral collapse appear several days to weeks after the onset of pain. As there is no dislocation with osteoporotic vertebral fractures, neurological signs and symptoms are rare. Pain is usually localized to the midline spine but may be referred, however, into the chest, abdomen, or leg. Any movement, including rolling in bed, bending, coughing, or lifting, usually exacerbates the pain.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pain, and muscle spasm if present, then gradually improves over the next several weeks and typically resolves in 4 to 6 weeks. Persistent severe pain</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(symptoms that continue despite the expected normal period of healing) may suggest additional fractures or an alternative diagnosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The presence of a vertebral fracture increases the risk of a subsequent vertebral and nonvertebral (ie, hip) fractures. Studies suggest that over 20% of patients who sustain a fracture will have another fracture within 5 years. The relationship between osteoporosis and vertebral fracture and chronic back pain and disability is still under investigation. Osteoporotic compression fractures that develop slowly over time are often asymptomatic and may not lead to deleterious sequelae. While some studies have shown increased disability in patients with vertebral fractures, a British population– based study found no correlation between minor vertebral deformities and back pain. Functional impairment from vertebral compression fracture appears to be comparable to that related to hip fracture.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Osteoporotic Sacral Fractures</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There have been a number of reports of “sacral/pelvic insufficiency fractures” as a cause of back pain. Older patients, usually women, may report persistent pain in the low back, groin, or buttock area, occasionally lasting weeks to months. The application of pressure to the sacrum is very painful.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Associated neurologic sequelae are rare; however, if present, they often manifest as a sacral radiculopathy. Leg length discrepancy, abnormal positioning of the leg, focal tenderness around the hip/pelvis, or limited range of motion of the leg should raise suspicion for pelvic injury. The pain usually resolves spontaneously in 4 to 6 weeks. Approximately 50% of these patients had a preceding fall, and the majority of patients have old pelvic and vertebral compression fractures on x-ray.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A sacral insufficiency fracture should be considered especially in older adults with risk factors for fracture (ie, osteoporosis, low body weight, glucocorticoid therapy) and with sudden pain in the low back and buttock with sacral tenderness. Plain radiographs of the pelvis, despite low sensitivity for small fractures, should be obtained to evaluate for the possibility of a hip, pelvic, or lumbosacral spine fracture. If plain films are negative but clinical suspicion is high, MRI or CT scan may be useful to document minor pelvic fractures. Some advocate for treating patients symptomatically without advanced imaging so long as other important diagnoses have been ruled out and appropriate follow-up has been arranged.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sciatica</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sciatica is usually defined as pain radiating down one leg below the gluteal fold. It is often felt in the buttock area, radiating into the posterior aspect of the leg down to the ankle. It may, however, be incomplete, as in the calf pain seen in the “pseudoclaudication” syndrome with lumbar spinal stenosis. The natural history of this condition is well defined in younger adults. Fifty percent of these patients have full resolution of symptoms within 6 weeks.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sciatica in older adults, which develops abruptly and occurs in all positions, usually has a good natural history, similar to that seen in younger individuals. Patients who develop sciatica as part of the lumbar spinal stenosis syndrome, with gradual progression of pain with shorter and shorter periods of standing and walking, may have a more prolonged and persistent natural history.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lumbar Spinal Stenosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lumbar spinal stenosis can be acquired or congenital. Congenital stenosis results from congenitally shortened pedicles and affects patients in their 30s to 50s. Acquired stenosis is more common and typically seen in patients 50 years and older. A good understanding of the normal anatomy of the lumbar spine is necessary to understand how spinal stenosis causes symptoms. The anterior border of the spinal canal is formed by the vertebral body, the disc, and posterior longitudinal ligament. The pedicle, lateral ligamentum flavum, and neural foraminal comprise the lateral border. The posterior border is formed by the facet joints, laminar, and ligamentum flavum. The shape of the spinal canal can be trefoil or oval, with the trefoil having the smallest cross- sectional area. Narrowing of the intraspinal (central) vertebral canal, lateral recess, and/or neural foramina is frequently seen on diagnostic imaging causing compression of the thecal sac and nerve roots. These abnormalities, often caused by spondylosis or degenerative arthritis affecting the spine, have clinical significance only if the typical history of lumbar spinal stenosis is present (<span class="s1">Table 102-3</span>). Spinal stenosis is associated with increased vascular disturbance, neuroinflammation, and electrophysiologic alteration, all of which contribute to the lower extremity pain experienced by patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the aforementioned static factors, the degenerative cascade can lead to translational and rotational abnormalities, which contribute to segmental instability and pain. Changes in spinal dynamics with movement explain some of the clinical features of lumbar spinal stenosis. Flexion of the lumbar spine decreases the intraspinal protrusion of the disc, decreases the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bulge of the yellow ligaments within the canal, and stretches and decreases the cross-sectional area of nerve roots, resulting in an increase in spinal canal volume in relation to nerve root bulk. Extension of the lumbar spine causes bulging of the disc into the canal, enfolding and protrusion of the yellow ligaments into the spinal canal, and a relaxation and increase of the cross-sectional diameter of nerve roots. Extension of the canal thus produces a decreased volume of the spinal canal in relation to nerve root bulk.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 102-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>CHARACTERISTICS OF LUMBAR SPINAL STENOSIS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">These changes in dynamics explain the clinical picture of lumbar spinal stenosis. Positions that extend the spine (standing, walking down hill, prone lying, and extending the back) worsen symptoms, while positions that flex the spine (sitting, bending forward, placing weight on a walker or cart, and lying in a flex position) relieve the symptoms.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis most commonly present with leg pain. The leg pain presents either as neurogenic claudication or radicular leg pain. With neurogenic claudication, patients report a feeling of lower extremity heaviness, numbness, cramping, burning, and infrequently weakness. Both legs are typically involved, although not infrequently one leg may be worse than the other. Rarely do lower extremity symptoms follow a dermatomal distribution, and are usually exacerbated by prolonged standing and walking. These symptoms are usually worse with extension, hence individuals with this condition often lean forward (lumbar flexion) with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ambulation to minimize discomfort and maximize function (ie, shopping cart sign). Lying supine, flexion, or squatting helps ameliorate symptoms. In contrast to neurogenic claudication, which arises from compression of the thecal sac, radiculopathy occurs as a result of lateral recess or foraminal compression. Since lumbar stenosis is most commonly observed at L4-L5, followed by L3-L4 and L5-S1, the L5 nerve root is most commonly involved from lateral recess stenosis causing an L5 radiculopathy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Lumbar spinal stenosis should not produce pain when going from lying to sitting and should not produce severe pain with bending, stooping, or lifting objects. New back pain/leg symptoms in an older patient and/or neurologic deficits usually warrant imaging to determine structural narrowing of the lumbosacral spine. Plain radiographs, MRI, and CT scans are important to fully characterize the degree of stenosis/spondylosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Severe neurological symptoms, such as profound lower extremity weakness, and bowel or bladder changes, are uncommon but when present mandate that a careful history is performed to exclude other nonspinal causes. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction is usually associated with perianal sensory disturbance, longer duration of symptoms, and higher postvoid residual volumes.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mechanical Low Back Pain</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The majority of older adults with low back pain do not have tumors, infections, vertebral compression fractures, or lumbar spinal stenosis (<span class="s1">Table 102-4</span>). They are best described as patients with mechanical back pain of uncertain etiology.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 102-4 <span class="s3">■ </span>CHARACTERISTICS OF MECHANICAL LOW BACK PAIN</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A good deal of back pain in younger individuals is probably caused by displacement of the outer annulus fibrosis or inner nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. The disc does not contain pain fibers: the perivertebral structures with the most sensitive pain fibers are the posterior longitudinal ligament and the dura mater, which lie posterior to the vertebrae and discs. The sinuvertebral nerve innervates these structures. Irritation of this nerve causes reflex spasms of the paravertebral muscles of the lumbar spine. It is, thus, logical to assume that soft-tissue displacement in this area will cause pain and limitation of some, but not all, of the planes of movement of the lumbar spine, spasm of the paravertebral muscles, and subtle weakness of the muscles innervated by the appropriate nerve roots (L4, L5, and S1—in most cases).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In a young adult’s lumbar spine, the central nucleus pulposus often herniates outside the annulus fibrosis and indents the pain-sensitive posterior longitudinal ligament and dura mater, producing pain that often lasts for several weeks and occasionally causing sciatica owing to nerve root irritation. Because the nucleus pulposus loses water content with aging, herniation of this structure is less common beyond the age of 55.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older patients often have a syndrome of sharp pain in the lumbar area, worsened with bending movements, which comes on and subsides rapidly but recurs frequently. On physical examination, these patients often have asymmetric loss of range of motion in the lumbar spine, paravertebral muscle spasm, weakness of the L4-, L5-, and S1-innervated muscles, and pain going from the flexed to the erect position. Clinicians often use the term “unstable lumbar spine” to describe this syndrome, although the evidence for specific mechanical instability is lacking. Patients with this condition often have one intervertebral disc space narrowed and sclerotic changes out of proportion to other disc spaces, and anterior displacement of one vertebra on another (spondylolisthesis). Maneuvers such as going from lying to sitting and bending forward often produce pain. Before considering major interventions, it is important to distinguish this condition, in which pain results from movement of the lumbar spine (eg, lying to sitting), from lumbar spinal stenosis, in which pain results from prolonged extension of the spine (standing and walking).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by calcification of prevertebral and peripheral ligaments. Ossification of spinal ligaments is often confused with osteophytes, and the condition is frequently mislabeled as disc degeneration or osteoarthritis. Spinal involvement is characterized by the following: (1) the presence of flowing calcification and ossification along the anterolateral aspect of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies, (2) relative preservation of intervertebral disc height in the involved area, and (3) the absence of apophyseal joint bony ankylosis or other features of ankylosing spondylitis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Most studies have not found any association with DISH and back pain, while other studies have noted an increase in ligamentous tenderness, stiffness, and immobility of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine in individuals with this condition. The condition should be distinguished from disc disease with vertebral osteophytes and is a cause of significant spinal immobility in older individuals.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The evaluation of the older adult with back pain should rely heavily on the history, physical examination, and direct observation. The history and physical examination remain the most helpful tools in the assessment of back pain in older adults, particularly because of the high false-positive rate of spinal diagnostic imaging tests in this age group. Laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging studies have a secondary role in the assessment of these patients. The clinician must verify that the clinical presentation of the patient fits the results of the diagnostic imaging tests before proceeding with interventions.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The role of the clinician in assessing and managing back pain in older individuals focuses on (1) identifying those conditions that require immediate attention (eg, infections and tumors), (2) recognizing the usual patterns of pain for defined causes of back pain, (3) assisting the patient to engage in therapy that mitigates pain and associated symptoms, (4) educating the patient on the natural history, precipitating events, and therapeutic approaches to nonspecific mechanical low back pain, and (5) establishing realistic expectations, identifying goals of management, and assessing progress toward these goals over time.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with a mechanical cause for pain usually have intermittent, positional pain, often with the peak intensity of pain at the episode onset (<span class="s1">Table 102-5</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 102-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>HISTORY ITEMS THAT HELP DIFFERENTIATE CAUSES OF BACK PAIN</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Pain that is worse on going from lying to sitting and with bending, that occurs when one suddenly changes position, and that resolves quickly but recurs frequently, suggests mechanical disease of the lumbar spine as a result of soft-tissue displacement. Severe pain in any position, which comes on abruptly and is aggravated by even rolling over in bed, suggests a vertebral compression fracture. A woman with sacral and buttock pain, sacral</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tenderness, and osteoporosis should be evaluated for a sacral insufficiency fracture. Gradually worsening progressive pain, lasting more than a month, which is nonpositional and associated with systemic symptoms and signs, might suggest the possibility of a tumor as a cause of the pain. Hip disease can often mimic back problems. Pain that is worse when going from sitting to standing, that causes a limp, or that radiates into the groin indicates possible hip disease.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physical Examination</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A good physical examination of patients with lumbar pathologies should start with observation. It is important to note whether patients are sitting flexed forward on a chair or laying down on the examination table. This provides clues on the possible etiology of the patient’s complaints. In patients where the supine position is preferred, mechanical back pain may be the predominant complaint. Next, the clinician must determine whether the problem is in the hip or back. It can be difficult to distinguish these conditions, as both can present with buttock and low back pain. Pain that occurs when going from the supine to sitting position is more apt to be from the back, while groin pain, worsened with weight bearing, favors the hip as the cause of the pain. A complete examination of the passive range of motion of the hip, done with the patient in the supine position, should reveal 40 degrees of hip abduction, more than 100 degrees of flexion, 50 to 60 degrees of external rotation, and 20 degrees of internal rotation. In addition, a manual muscle examination of the lower extremities, which demonstrates mild weakness of the L4, L5 (hip abductor and great toe extensor) and L5, S1 (hip extensors) innervated muscles of the lower extremities, favors the back as the cause of pain. One study demonstrated that the presence of groin pain, a limp, and limited internal rotation of the hip all favored the hip as the cause of pain.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Several findings on physical examination can be useful in determining discrete causes of back pain (<span class="s1">Table 102-6</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 102-6 <span class="s3">■ </span>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS THAT HELP DIFFERENTIATE CAUSES OF BACK PAIN</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The physical examination of the lumbar spine is an essential component of the assessment of a patient with back pain (<span class="s1">Figure 102-1</span>). This is best done while standing. The examiner observes the patient for kyphosis or scoliosis and then palpates for paravertebral muscle spasm. The patient is then brought through the four ranges of motion of the lumbar spine, side flexion to the right, side flexion to the left, forward flexion, and extension, observing for asymmetric limitation of motion or reproduction of the patient’s pain by these maneuvers (see <span class="s1">Figure 102-1</span>). In the supine position, straight leg raise tests can indicate nerve root irritation if positive, but a negative test does not exclude any condition. The hips should be examined by testing the passive range of motion. The examiner should be able to abduct the leg to 40 degrees before the pelvis tilts. There should be 60 degrees of external rotation (heel toward the midline) and 20 degrees of internal rotation (heel away from the midline) of each hip (<span class="s1">Figure 102-2</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIGURE 102-1. <span class="s5">Range of motion of lumbar spine.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIGURE 102-2. <span class="s5">Resisting abduction of the leg.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Manual muscle testing of the lower extremity gives much useful information, as subtle L4, L5 and L5, S1 weakness is common in patients with mechanical back pain. L4, L5 is tested by resisting the patient’s abducted leg at the lateral upper thigh (gluteus medius muscle) (see <span class="s1">Figure 102-2</span>), by resisting the patient’s ability to dorsiflex the foot (tibialis anterior muscle), and by resisting the great toe extensor (extensor hallucis longus) (<span class="s1">Figure 102-3</span>). L5, S1 (gluteus maximus muscle) is tested by trying to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">overcome hip extension (trying to pull the leg off the examining table, when the patient has been instructed to hold the leg firmly on the table). One can also test L5, S1 by resisting the patient’s ability to evert the foot (peroneus longus and peroneus brevis).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIGURE 102-3. <span class="s5">Resisting great toe extensor.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Most patients with lumbar disc disease or lumbar spinal stenosis will have some abnormalities of the examination of the lumbar spine or of the muscles innervated by L4, L5 or L5, S1. Patients with vertebral compression fractures may have a good deal of tenderness in the lumbar spine but should have no neurologic abnormalities. Patients with osteoporotic sacral fractures will have sacral tenderness, but a normal lumbar spine examination and no lower extremity muscle weakness. Those with sciatica almost always have L4, L5 and L5, S1 weakness. A patient with persistent, severe back pain, but with a normal examination of the lumbar spine, sacrum, and hips and no evidence of L4, L5 or L5, S1 muscle weakness, should be evaluated thoroughly for a possible neoplasm or infection.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">New neurologic abnormalities (dermatomal sensory deficits, focal weakness, clonus) associated with abrupt onset back pain may suggest retropulsed bone fragments in the spinal canal or foraminae which should be further evaluated with urgent MRI or CT scan and urgent consultation with a spine surgeon.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Laboratory Tests and Imaging</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The interpretation of diagnostic tests in older patients with back pain is a challenge, given the high rate of abnormal tests in asymptomatic individuals in this age group. A complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein are reasonable screening tests if the patient’s history and physical examination suggest a tumor or infection. While routine imaging for low back pain in younger populations is not recommended, plain films of the spine may be appropriate in older adults with back pain. A plain x-ray of the lumbar spine is more helpful in the evaluation of older patients than younger ones, as it may demonstrate a vertebral compression fracture, DISH, or spondylolisthesis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">According to the American College of Radiology, the criteria listed in <span class="s1">Table 102-7 </span>should be used to determine who is at higher risk for systemic disease-related back pain and when imaging is appropriate.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 102-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>RED FLAGS FOR BACK PAIN DUE TO SYSTEMIC DISEASE</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The clinician must be aware that changes in the lumbar spine are ubiquitous in older individuals and not well correlated with back pain. Kellgren and Lawrence’s classic epidemiological study in Leigh, England, found that 89% of the men and 57% of the women aged 55 to 64 had disc degeneration of the lumbar spine. Proper radiographic evaluation of the lumbar spine includes obtaining static and dynamic views. Anterior- posterior, lateral and flexion-extension views should be obtained. Specific findings notable on plain films include narrow interpedicular distance, sagittal canal diameter, and evidence of spondylotic changes such as facet hypertrophy, osteophytosis, disc collapse, or deformity. Additionally, vacuum disc phenomenon “air in disc space” can be noted on plain radiographs, and is a sign of advanced degeneration and instability. A study of lumbar sacral spine x-rays found no association between back pain and Schmorl nodes, the disc vacuum sign, traction spurs, and disc space narrowing between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, or between the fifth lumbar and first sacral vertebrae. There was an association between acute low back pain and disc space narrowing, and traction spurs between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra. Another study found no correlation between vertebral osteophytes and low back pain but did find increased back pain in individuals with spondylolisthesis (pars interarticularis defect and frontal slippage of one vertebra on an adjacent vertebra).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">MRI is considered the standard imaging modality for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. It is used to identify central and lateral recess stenosis, annular tears, facet degeneration, and diastasis, because it provides excellent contrast between fat, neural tissue, and epineural vessels. A disadvantage of MRI is its ability to detect degenerative changes that may not be associated with symptoms. MRIs of the lumbar spine often demonstrate anatomic abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals, especially in older adults. In one study of MRIs of the lumbar spine in patients without back pain, only 36% had a normal examination; 52% of these individuals had a disc bulge in at least one level, and 27% had disc protrusions. In another study of asymptomatic individuals, 36% of subjects older than 60 years had a herniated nucleus pulposus, 21% had spinal stenosis, and 93% had degenerative disc disease. Another study found that 56% of asymptomatic individuals had tears of the annulus fibrosis of the lumbar disc. In a study of 198 veterans who had had no back pain for at least 4 months, 83% had moderate-to-severe degeneration of the disc, 64% had at least one bulging</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">disc, and 32% had at least one disc protrusion. In individuals older than 65 years, 100% had disc degeneration and desiccation, 83% had a disc bulge, and 38% had facet joint degeneration.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">CT scans are also useful for evaluation of lumbar stenosis. CT offers greater detail than plain films, with ability to obtain images in various planes</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">—axial, coronal, and sagittal. Other potential causes of back pain such as pars interarticular defects and spondylosis can be easily identified with CT scans. In stenotic patients, hypertrophy of the facet joints and articular processes contribute to the trefoil shape of the central canal. Because a significant portion of the stenosis comes from soft tissue pathology, visualization of the soft tissues is a top priority. A CT scan is a poor modality for detailed analysis of soft tissue. The diagnostic utility of CT scan can be improved by combining it with myelography. CT myelography is infrequently used for routine evaluation of spinal stenosis; however, this modality can be useful in patients with lumbar deformity, such as scoliosis or those unable to tolerate an MRI. Central stenosis presents as a hourglass constriction of the thecal sac. Areas of complete contrast block represent severe central or foraminal stenosis. While CT myelography provides useful information on areas of central or foraminal stenosis, invasiveness of the myelogram and radiation associated with the CT scans are the two biggest drawbacks of this diagnostic modality.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Bicycle and treadmill tests help to differentiate between neurogenic claudication and vascular claudication. Patients with neurogenic claudication present with symptoms including pain, cramping, and lower extremity paresthesias, which are also common in older patients with underlying vascular claudication. With neurogenic claudication, patients have worse symptoms during the treadmill test that is relieved during the bicycle test.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is because the flexion of the spine that occurs during the bicycle test increases the diameter of the central canal. In contrast, patients with vascular claudication have persistent difficulty with both treadmill and bicycle test.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) can be helpful when evaluating patients with a history that is not classic for neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy. EMG identifies lower motor neuron dysfunction and can be useful in differentiating chronic changes from active ongoing denervation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The above findings indicate that the clinician cannot depend on imaging studies alone to diagnose the cause of back pain in older adults. These</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">studies are used to confirm a diagnosis, indicated by the history, physical examination, and the clinician’s knowledge of applied anatomy.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MANAGEMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Back pain in older adults is often inadequately treated for several reasons including: a limited evidence base to guide management, lack of physician education, physician concerns about the potential for treatment-related harm, and older adults’ beliefs about pain and pain treatments. Other treatment barriers specific to geriatric populations include <i>age-related </i>physiologic changes resulting in altered drug absorption and decreased renal excretion; sensory impairments; polypharmacy; and multimorbidity. Additional attitudinal, access, and system-level barriers have been identified that also contribute to undertreated pain in vulnerable populations, including older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Management of back pain should begin with a combination of nonpharmacologic and rehabilitative approaches, as described below, along with pharmacologic and then more invasive management strategies if indicated, depending on the circumstance (listed by specific etiology).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic Approaches (General Principles)</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Interest in nonpharmacologic approaches for managing back pain in older adults is increasing. Nonpharmacologic approaches include cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain, acupuncture, mindfulness, massage, self- management programs and/or behavioral (eg, goal setting, exercise, tai chi, yoga) techniques that constitute well-established methods for treating pain (in general). Existing evidence suggests that these therapies are safe, can reduce pain, and in many cases improve patient function. Nearly all studies of nonpharmacologic interventions conducted to date, however, have been for short term (&lt; 6 months). The long-term efficacy and ability of older adults to sustain their use over time remain inadequately defined. Despite this, temporary relief from back pain may offer an opportunity to develop positive expectations and commitments from the patient and provider.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It is important to communicate to older patients that using both nondrug and drug therapies is the standard of care and can be productive, particularly with individuals who may hesitate to engage in nonpharmacologic treatments. Recommending a specific nonpharmacologic modality will depend upon its availability, affordability (eg, Medicare does not cover many of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">approaches listed, however), patient preferences, and the physician’s ability to accurately describe its benefits and risks. As there are no head-to-head comparisons evaluating the nonpharmacologic approaches, recommending a modality that is accessible and affordable is essential.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rehabilitative Approaches</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Addressing function and fall risk is critically important for all older patients, particularly in those with persistent pain, including chronic back pain.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rehabilitative therapies, including physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT), can help maintain and possibly enhance functional independence. Geriatric pain management guidelines recommend that all older patients with persistent pain (including back pain) adopt physical activity regimens that include strengthening, flexibility, balance, and endurance exercises. PTs/OTs can help older adults implement individualized home-based treatment programs. Home-based services directed at improving safety and mobility could potentially facilitate involvement in out-of-home activities; these services might indirectly yield dividends such as more time spent socializing with family and friends.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Physical therapists can play an important role in developing “function- enhancing interventions” in older adults with mobility limitations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition, PTs can conduct an inventory of existing equipment (eg, does the patient have a functional walker?) and make recommendations about new assistive/mobility devices. OTs can directly observe a patient’s ADL functioning in the home and make recommendations about assistive devices that may help to improve ADL functioning. Both paid and family caregivers, especially of older adults with cognitive impairment, can reinforce patients’ ongoing use of rehabilitative techniques and should be engaged and empowered to do so. Finally, PTs/OTs can also train caregivers to reinforce concepts learned during treatment sessions, including coaching on fall risk, safety, body mechanics, and pacing.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Rehabilitation health care specialists often use various modalities including both therapeutic exercise and spinal manipulation. There is growing popularity and interest in spinal manipulation (often defined as [low to] high velocity and low amplitude thrust and/or manual mobilization of vertebral joints and/or soft tissue manipulation, performed by either a chiropractor, physiotherapist, or other manual health care practitioner) for both acute and chronic back pain. As of yet, there are no studies proving the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mechanism underlying the benefit of spinal manipulation. There are strongest data for patients with acute low back pain (without radiculopathy); however, this population has a favorable prognosis even without manipulation. Most studies have focused on chronic back pain, and often exclude subjects with spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis (second degree or more), lumbar scoliosis (&gt; 20 degrees or more), osteoporosis and previous vertebral fractures (seen more often in older adults), systemic causes of chronic back pain (including ankylosing spondylitis, infection, or metastatic disease), or psychiatric or cognitive comorbidities. In the general population (including younger adults), spinal manipulative therapy and spinal stabilization have shown improvements in both pain and function as compared to various treatments (back school—education, relaxation techniques, postural and tailored back exercises, individual physiotherapy—mobilization, active exercise, massage, education, or general exercise), especially in the short term. While data suggest there is a statistically significant improvement with spinal manipulation, its clinical importance remains uncertain.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ETIOLOGY-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Therapy of tumors and infectious causes of low back pain is straightforward albeit often difficult. Appropriate management of vertebral compression fractures, lumbar spinal stenosis, and mechanical low back pain is less clear.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vertebral Compression Fractures</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The traditional treatment for vertebral compression fractures is activity modification and pain control at the onset of symptoms. Oral analgesics are usually needed for acute pain relief. These include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mild opioids combined with acetaminophen, tramadol, or medications that block serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake. Calcitonin (2- to 4-week course) does have some additional analgesic effect in the acute stage. The choice of first-line agent depends on severity of symptoms and the patient’s comorbidities. Muscle relaxants have not been rigorously evaluated in this setting and given the high rate of adverse effects in older adults should be used cautiously, if at all.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Opioids, when necessary, should be used cautiously given known side effects particularly in older adults (sedation/altered mental status, constipation, nausea). For severe pain, hospitalization for pain management may be warranted.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Complete bed rest is not recommended, patients should resume physical activity as soon as possible (as pain permits). Physical therapy should focus on gait and core strengthening. Aquatic therapy has been shown to accelerate pain relief and physical activities. In several studies, exercise programs have reduced analgesic use and improved quality of life in older adults with vertebral fractures. Education including management of expectations (eg, that it can take several months for the pain to improve) is essential. Bracing is not usually needed for pain management from osteoporotic compression fractures, although it has been shown to be helpful in acute management of patients with traumatic vertebral compression fractures. Long-term use of bracing should be avoided as its use may lead to immobility of the spine, weakening of paraspinal and core muscles, as well as potential for disuse osteoporosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Long-term management of vertebral compression fractures, related to osteoporosis, focuses on improving low bone density (ie, antiresorptive therapy). Underlying conditions that are present and may contribute to development of vertebral compression fractures (hyperthyroidism, granulomatous diseases, infections) require further, specific management beyond the scope of this chapter. Lifestyle modification, namely, smoking cessation and reducing alcohol use, are important. Fall prevention education is effective and essential especially in older adults who have already experienced a traumatic fall or at risk for falls.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is much interest in vertebral augmentation (the techniques of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty) in the management of vertebral compression fractures. In a vertebroplasty, extension positioning opens the cleft within a fractured vertebral body, and bone cement is injected into the vertebral body and stabilizes the fracture in this position. In a kyphoplasty, an inflated bone balloon displaces vertebral trabelate and elevates the superior end plate, allowing some restoration of the height of the vertebral body. The balloon is then removed and bone cement is injected into the vertebral space.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The indications and timing for the use of these augmentation procedures remain controversial. Current evidence supporting use of these procedures is of low quality. In the acute setting, although uncontrolled studies show encouraging relief of pain with vertebroplasty, the favorable natural history of the pain from compression fractures, and the potential complications and expense of this procedure, should lend caution to its use. In one nonrandomized trial, the control patients were those who elected not to have</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the procedure. The pain score was significantly decreased in the vertebroplasty group as compared to the conservative therapy group in the first few days, but there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes at 6 weeks or 6 to 12 months. In a study of patients who had pain for greater than 1 year associated with compression fractures, kyphoplasty was performed on 40 patients, with 20 control patients who elected not to have the procedure. At 1 year, the patients with kyphoplasty had fewer new fractures, fewer back pain–related physicians’ visits, and greater improvement in pain scores. Again, neither of these studies were randomized controlled trials. Most experts in this field suggest analgesics, calcitonin, and exercise in the acute phase, and moving on to vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty only if patients have persistent severe pain despite conservative management (and the pain is thought to arise from the fracture).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lumbar Spinal Stenosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conservative nonsurgical therapies, alone and in combination, are warranted prior to attempting surgical treatment. Physical therapy is advocated for this condition, but there is little evidence to justify advocating one treatment regimen over another. The goal of therapy is to increase muscular stabilization (often via strengthening of abdominal muscles) and correction of posture (reduce or prevent lumbar lordosis). In general, stretching, strengthening, and aerobic fitness are advocated. Along with physical therapy, analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications (as monotherapy or in combination) are often used.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The choice of nonsurgical treatment is difficult, as there are few randomized controlled trials of these therapies. Epidural steroid injections have been used for more than 50 years for sciatica. While there are a number of uncontrolled studies suggesting a good outcome with these injections for lumbar spinal stenosis, randomized controlled trials have produced inconsistent results. A randomized trial of 400 older adults with lumbar spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe leg pain and disability showed minimal or no short-term benefit in outcomes (disability and leg pain intensity) between the group who received epidural steroid injections of glucocorticoids plus lidocaine versus injection with lidocaine alone. A placebo group was not included in this study.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The decision to proceed with spine surgery in an older patient is always a difficult one. An increasing number of studies support surgical</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">decompression for symptomatic lumbar stenosis. Evidence-based guidelines now recommend surgery for patients with moderate to severe spinal stenosis. The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT), a multicenter randomized control trial (with younger patients, average age in the 40s), one of the largest and well-known studies to date, demonstrated significant advantages associated with surgery compared to nonoperative treatment at 3 months that remained significant and durable through the 2-year duration of the study. It is unclear how results would differ among older adults with comparable spine pathology. At 8-year follow-up, 52% of patients randomized to nonoperative treatment had undergone surgery. A Cochrane review of surgery for degenerative lumbar spondylosis found that “there is still insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of surgery to draw any firm conclusions.” On the other hand, the Maine Lumbar Spinal study did show that spinal surgery can be effective. This study is an observational analysis of patients treated by orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in community- based practices throughout Maine. This study followed patients treated surgically or medically, at the choice of the patient and surgeon. In this cohort, patients initially treated surgically demonstrated better outcomes in all measures than those treated nonsurgically. After 10 years, however, the relative difference between surgery and conservative therapy was no longer significant. A randomized controlled multicenter trial of an interspinous process decompression system did find that patients who underwent this procedure had a statistically significant improvement in neurogenic intermittent claudication versus controls.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For patients who have failed maximum nonsurgical management (physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, activity modification, injections) and require surgery, patient selection is critical to optimize the likelihood of a successful outcome. Patients with symptomatic neurogenic claudication, with primary complaints of lower extremity pain, numbness, and paresthesias with prolonged ambulation are ideal candidates for surgery. An observational study from four surgical centers found that the most powerful predictors of good outcomes of greater walking capacity, milder symptoms, and greater satisfaction were the patient’s report of good or excellent health before surgery, as well as low cardiovascular comorbidity. A variety of surgical options exist including decompressive laminectomy with or without fusion, laminotomy, or placement of interspinous devices. Surgical decompression can be performed through traditional open techniques or newer minimally</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">invasive approaches. The majority of these procedures are performed on an outpatient basis with patients usually discharged home on the day of surgery. Prior to surgical intervention, a thorough review of the static and dynamic radiographs, MRI, and CT scans is important. Preoperative identification of spinal instability, preferably by flexion-extension radiographs, is critical to avoid procedures that further destabilize the spine.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Surgery in older adults is associated with higher adverse events rates, which should be discussed with the patient along with the understanding of long-term outcomes from surgery. Complication rates of lumbar decompressive surgeries range from 1.8% to 18% and include wound infection, durotomy, nerve root injury, vascular complications, epidural hematoma, implant failures, adjacent segment degeneration, and nonunion.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In summary, lumbar spinal stenosis should be treated first with a conservative approach including physical therapy, perhaps manipulative therapy, analgesics, and possibly epidural steroid injections. If this approach does not give relief in a reasonable period of time, then a surgical approach, decompressing the stenotic canal space, should be considered. Those patients with high self-reported health and low cardiovascular morbidity seem to achieve the best surgical results.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mechanical Low Back Pain</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The management of back pain in older persons requires a logical, if not yet evidence-based, approach based on both an anatomical understanding of the most likely cause and precipitants of the older adult’s pain. For pain that is exacerbated by spinal movement (lying to sitting, bending, etc), spinal instability is the most likely explanation, and thus attempts to stabilize the spine make the most sense. Stabilization may be achieved by isometric abdominal strengthening exercises, lumbar sacral corsets (avoid using for extended periods of time due to muscle disuse/deconditioning), and back protection maneuvers (lifting with one’s knees with the back straight, etc).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spinal fusion is reserved for intractable cases of severe low back pain where there is radiographic evidence of progressive deformity, dynamic instability, or pars interarticularis defects.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is no therapy needed or indicated for DISH. The pain from sacral insufficiency fractures resolves in 4 to 6 weeks, and analgesics should suffice. Antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis should be initiated to prevent future fractures.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Spontaneous sciatica usually improves without therapy in most older adults. Epidural steroids may be helpful in the management of sciatica.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surgery should be considered only if the pain persists despite trials of conservative therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Prolonged bed rest should be avoided in older adults, given the complications of this intervention in this age group. Patients should, however, avoid those activities that appear to precipitate their pain. Firm corsets may be considered to allow patients to stay mobile and active.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Analgesics should be used, though cautiously, in the management of pain, especially if used chronically. There is little evidence that anti-inflammatory drugs are any better than simple analgesics, and these are associated with a high incidence of complications in this age group. Pain that occurs only with movement often does not respond well to analgesics. While opioid medications may be very helpful with severe pain, the older patient should be watched closely for confusion and constipation. Adjunctive pain therapy, with such agents as tricyclic antidepressants with limited anticholinergic side effects (nortriptyline and disimpramine) and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin), may also be helpful but can produce unwanted side effects that limit therapeutic benefit in older adults. The use of combinations of multiple analgesic classes (at the lowest effective dose) may be effective at reducing pain while keeping side effects to a minimum.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PREVENTION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since back pain in older adults is often recurrent and, while chronic back pain is often reported in the literature, the symptoms often wax and wane. The older adult can usually identify a precipitating event or certain activities or movements that make the back pain worse or prompt a recurrent episode. Once aware of these movements, the clinician can work with the patient to modify behavior and activity to minimize or avoid such movements. Further, it is important to recognize certain risk factors for developing more disabling back pain: being female, having multiple comorbid conditions (including arthritis), reporting depressive symptoms, and having poor grip strength (this may serve as a marker for global muscle weakness) or hip weakness.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Obesity is also considered a risk factor for back pain. Several of these risk factors, namely depressive symptoms, muscle weakness, and body mass index are potentially modifiable and amenable to intervention via primary care interventions. Back pain is also associated with psychosocial</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">repercussion, including anxiety, depression, and social isolation. Expanding the evaluation and management of back pain from physical to include psychosocial aspects of daily life may provide benefits for older adults who suffer from these conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SPECIAL ISSUES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While back pain in older adults is prevalent, costly, and leads to considerable morbidity, much of the literature has focused on younger populations with this condition. Few trials comparing efficacy and safety of different treatments have included older adults with back pain. Pain management and treatment are particularly challenging because clinical guidelines do not currently exist for back pain in older adults; moreover, guidelines for back pain in younger populations fail to account for decision- making complexities that occur commonly in older populations, such as multiple comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, frailty, and fragmented social support systems.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Therapeutic Alliance and Patient Preference</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The patient-physician relationship lies at the center of treatment for older adults with (chronic) back pain. Therapeutic alliance is defined as a constructive collaboration between the patient and provider. Although few studies have addressed the specific contribution of the therapeutic alliance to treatment outcomes in patients with back pain, a positive patient-physician relationship has been associated with improved treatment outcomes among patients receiving general and rehabilitative medical care. Devoting the time to establish mutually agreed-upon treatment goals is an important step in building a therapeutic alliance. Other core elements of the therapeutic alliance include (1) setting realistic expectations about what can and cannot be accomplished, taking into account such immutable factors as patient age, etiology, and duration of the pain; (2) availability of the physician for advice, reassurance, and support during back pain flares; (3) tenacity and commitment on the part of both provider and patient; (4) mutual respect; and finally, (5) a reciprocal bond of warmth generated by both parties having an emotional investment in the outcomes of treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Discussing and listening to patient preferences regarding management and goals of care are essential. Management programs can be tailored to the older adult’s preferences and abilities; preferably, the patient has identified</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aspects of the program that are most desirable, realistic, and feasible, thus increasing likelihood of adherence. To motivate older adults to engage with a management program, the environment in which the older patient completes therapeutic activity should be appropriate and accessible. In order to reinforce treatment initiation and maintenance, the physician can leverage social supports, for example, family members, home attendants, and community-based agencies.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Comorbidity <span class="p">As noted above, multimorbidity and medical complexity often seen in older adults make management decisions more difficult and sometimes limit treatment options. Further, it is important to recognize that older adults often have multiple sites of pain. Clinicians should inquire about different concomitant locations of pain (eg, spine, knee, hand, hip, peripheral neuropathy) as this may impact management options, patient priorities, treatment expectations, and ultimately achieving outcomes of interest. Mental illness (eg, depression and anxiety) often co-occurs with chronic (back) pain and must be acknowledged and managed optimally (and simultaneously) for pain outcomes to also improve.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Care se ttings <span class="p">Multiple resources exist to help both clinicians and patients manage back pain. We advocate for clinicians to seek out/learn about resources that exist within their respective communities by contacting the local Area Agency on Aging (AoA) to find out if they have lists of relevant programs. Also, for example, many continuing care retirement communities offer wellness/exercise programs that are run by trained staff.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leo Cooney, Jr., MD, authored this chapter in the sixth edition, and some material from that chapter has been retained here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Abdulla A, Adams N, Bone M, et al.

Health care professionals have been poorly educated about these common and treatable conditions, and they are often confused with each other. We discuss them in the same chapter to highlight their distinct characteristics. Because MPSs are so commonplace, patients with fibromyalgia often have coexisting MPS. MPS may be acute or chronic and is associated with regional pain syndromes, taut muscle bands, and hypersensitive areas called trigger points. Fibromyalgia syndrome includes symptoms of sleep disruption, fatigue, and psychological distress in addition to widespread pain. Both fibromyalgia and MPS may result in significant functional impairment and cause suffering and disability comparable to that of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Diagnosis of these disorders is grounded in appropriately targeted history and physical examination; these are the tools required to avoid unnecessary ordering of “diagnostic” tests and foster implementation of appropriate management strategies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIBROMYALGIA SYNDROME</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fibromyalgia Criteria: Historical Perspective</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The gold standard for diagnosing fibromyalgia (FM) is clinical evaluation by a specialist.

In 2010, Wolfe and colleagues put forth new criteria that did not require a tender point exam and queried symptoms other than pain. These criteria were revised in 2011, then converted into a self-report questionnaire useful for epidemiological research (<span class="s1">Figure 103-1</span>). Scoring instructions are found in the legend of <span class="s1">Figure 103-1 </span>and scores of greater than or equal to 13 are 96.6% sensitive and 91.8% specific, compared with the 1990 ACR criteria, which are 81% sensitive and 88% specific.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 103-1. <span class="s5">Modified Fibromyalgia Criteria 2011: A Survey.

According to these original criteria, women are four to seven times as likely to have fibromyalgia compared to men, with the greatest prevalence in those 60 to 79 years of age. When using the 2011 survey, the female-to-male ratio drops to</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.8:1 overall and 3.4:1 in those aged 60 and older. Experts suggest that elimination of the tender point examination and addition of the somatic symptoms scale improves the identification of fibromyalgia in men. Patients with fibromyalgia are estimated to have a two- to sevenfold greater risk of suffering from depression, anxiety, headache, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy individuals. Fibromyalgia patients display comorbid pain disorders, known as chronic overlapping pain conditions, which are listed in <span class="s1">Table 103-2</span>. This heterogeneous group of pain conditions tend to occur more frequently in women and are associated with sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, and poor physical function.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 103-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>FIBROMYALGIA-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND DISORDERS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PATHOGENESIS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While recent studies have added to our understanding of fibromyalgia’s pathogenesis, the exact cause is still unknown and considered to be multifactorial.

Potential environmental triggers include acute pain and trauma, viral infections (Epstein-Barr virus, Lyme disease, Q fever, viral hepatitis), and psychological stress.

style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patient history</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fibromyalgia patients often report that they feel pain “all over.” Pain diagrams, on which patients are asked to shade painful areas of a human figure, help make the diagnosis. For fibromyalgia patients, these diagrams show diffuse shading on the right and left sides of the body as well as above and below the waist. We observe that some fibromyalgia patients shade, circle, or put an X through the entire figure. Patients generally rate their pain as moderate to severe in intensity. Over time, pain will fluctuate in severity but typically does not resolve completely. Pain descriptions vary widely from deep and aching to mildly tender or sharp. Symptoms are generally constant throughout the day but often are worse in the morning and the evening. Triggers, including stress, cold weather, illness, and unaccustomed exertion, will likely increase pain. In addition to pain, 75% of patients report stiffness, and over 50% report a sensation of swelling. Low back pain and chronic whiplash are relatively common and affect 20% to 30% of fibromyalgia patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Fibromyalgia patients are likely to describe a wide variety of nonmusculoskeletal symptoms, most commonly fatigue and difficulty sleeping. Sixty percent of patients report psychological and neuropsychological symptoms, including anxiety, mental distress, and cognitive dysfunction. Thirty percent of patients report current depression, with over 50% of patients reporting a history of depression. Headaches are also common. Uncommon symptoms (&lt; 20% prevalence) include tinnitus, dizziness, vertigo, and Raynaud phenomenon. Studies demonstrate that fibromyalgia may coexist in 17% of patients with osteoarthritis, 21% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 37% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. <span class="s1">Table 103-2 </span>lists the symptoms and syndromes commonly associated with fibromyalgia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Up to 80% of fibromyalgia patients report debilitating fatigue. This complaint encompasses mental fatigue and impaired concentration, commonly referred to as “fibro fog,” physical fatigue after exertion, and general sleepiness. In fibromyalgia patients, these symptoms most often occur in the absence of other medical illnesses. Neuropsychological performance testing demonstrates objective deficits in patients with fibromyalgia, most notably inhibitory control and short-/long-term memory. It is important, therefore, that neuropsychological performance testing results in the older</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adult with fibromyalgia are interpreted in the context of typical neuropsychological performance deficits related to fibromyalgia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Poor sleep quality seen in fibromyalgia patients is known as nonrestorative sleep. A number of sleep abnormalities have been documented in fibromyalgia patients and are listed in <span class="s1">Table 103-4</span>. A recent large epidemiologic study found that improvements in restorative sleep correlate with the resolution of chronic widespread pain.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 103-4 <span class="s3">■ </span>SLEEP ABNORMALITIES IN FIBROMYAGLIA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When evaluating the older adult with widespread chronic pain, the practitioner should be mindful of fibromyalgia-associated rheumatologic disorders such as generalized osteoarthritis, pseudogout, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and polymyalgia rheumatica, as summarized in <span class="s1">Table 103-5</span>. A careful history and thorough physical examination for synovial and extrasynovial findings can help differentiate these conditions from fibromyalgia. <span class="s1">Table 103-5 </span>lists many key features on history and physical examination that help diagnose fibromyalgia. Other diagnostic considerations include hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, demyelinating polyneuropathies, and paraneoplastic syndromes. A targeted laboratory panel may help tease out these differential diagnostic considerations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s523" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 103-5 <span class="s524">■ </span>DIFFERENTIATION OF OSTEOARTHRITIS FROM OTHER COMMON RHEUMATOLOGIC DISORDERS: HISTORY, PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The practitioner should review all medications when assessing the older adult with widespread pain. Toxic myopathy is a well-documented and dose- related side effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and high-dose corticosteroids (30 mg of prednisone equivalents per day). The antiretroviral agent zidovudine, the antifungal agent voriconazole, and several immunosuppressant medications, including interferon, cyclosporin, and tacrolimus, may cause painful myopathies. Commonly abused drugs, including cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, and alcohol, also cause painful myopathies. Symptoms typically begin within weeks to months of drug exposure and resolve with discontinuation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TREATMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are available for the treatment of fibromyalgia. There are not first-line fibromyalgia treatments, and evidence-based guidelines vary. Most experts agree that effective treatment starts with patient education and integrates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies, as illustrated in <span class="s1">Figure 103-</span></p><ol id="l80"><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the response is likely to be modest, we have successfully employed a number of management approaches in our older adult patients with fibromyalgia.

The analgesic effect of antidepressants may result from increased central nervous system serotonin</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and norepinephrine, which block pain signals from the periphery. In addition to reducing pain, antidepressants may improve sleep and emotional well- being. Those used most commonly are the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) may be less effective than the SNRIs for treating chronic pain. However, some practitioners find SSRIs more effective for treating depression. Fibromyalgia treatment guidelines recommend TCAs in doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg at night. A comparative review of amitriptyline versus other FDA-approved fibromyalgia medications found similar improvements in pain and fatigue. Cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant with structural similarity to the tricyclics, has shown efficacy in several short-term clinical trials.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Even in low doses, TCAs have significant side effects that limit use. This class’s anticholinergic effects are responsible for most of the adverse effects, including sedation, confusion, constipation, and palpitations. TCAs may contribute to impaired mobility and cause falls in older adults. TCAs may also prolong the QT interval, which results in torsade de pointes and death.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Practitioners should obtain a baseline electrocardogram to assess cardiac rhythm prior to starting TCAs and monitor periodically during use.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to FDA guidelines for QTc prolongation with antidepressant use, QTc increases of greater than 10 ms over baseline are of “increasing concern” and greater than 20 ms are of “definite concern.” FDA guidelines caution against prescribing/continuing TCAs when QTc intervals are greater than 500 ms or have increased 60 ms or more over baseline. Secondary tricyclic amines, desipramine, and nortriptyline have fewer side effects but are not as well studied.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Practitioners may favor SNRIs compared to TCAs for fibromyalgia as they have fewer adverse effects. Duloxetine (60 mg daily) and milnacipran (100–200 mg daily) are FDA-approved for fibromyalgia. Both duloxetine and milnacipran improve pain, depression, and quality of life. Compared to duloxetine, milnacipran is a more potent inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake and may be more effective for patients with fatigue and cognitive symptoms. SNRIs may elevate blood pressure in some patients, and vital signs should be monitored routinely. Common side effects are nausea and orthostatic hypotension and may be reduced by taking the medication with food and using slow titration. We recommend starting duloxetine at 20 mg daily and increasing to 60 mg slowly over at least several weeks. If the practitioner</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">decides to discontinue the drug, this also must be done slowly to avoid SNRI withdrawal syndrome. We recommend slowly decreasing the dose by no more than 50% at 1 to 2 weeks intervals. Standard recommendations for milnacipran are to start with 12.5 mg daily and slowly titrate to 50 mg bid.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The authors of this chapter do not prescribe milnacipran for older adults because of lack of data in this age group.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Antie pileptics </span>Aside from the antidepressants, very few drug classes have evidence for efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Some studies support using the antiepileptic drugs gabapentin (currently available in generic form) and pregabalin. Research suggests that antiepileptic drugs reduce neuronal excitability, decrease ectopic neuronal discharge, and modulate various neurotransmitter levels. A large study of pregabalin, which binds to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel, found that fibromyalgia patients experienced significant improvement in pain, fatigue, social functioning, vitality, and general health perception compared to controls. Pregabalin, in doses ranging from 300 to 450 mg daily, was the first medication approved for fibromyalgia syndrome. A recent meta-analysis of anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia found mild improvements with pregabalin in pain, sleep, and fatigue compared to placebo. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence to support gabapentin for fibromyalgia, our clinical experience suggests that low doses (eg, 100–600 mg/day) may help reduce pain and improve sleep. Sedation and dizziness are common side effects of both medications and may contribute to falls in older adults. These are minimized by starting with low bedtime doses and slowly titrating upward. <span class="s1">Table 103-7 </span>compares the benefits and side effects of the three FDA-approved fibromyalgia medications.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 103-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>SUMMARY COMPARISON OF FDA-APPROVED DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF FIBROMYALGIA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analgesics <span class="p">Except for tramadol, there are no data to support the efficacy of analgesics for fibromyalgia treatment. Tramadol, a weak mu receptor agonist with dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, is unique in its mechanism and was effective for fibromyalgia symptoms in three randomized controlled trials.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hormonal supplements and othe r agents <span class="p">Studies of hormonal supplements for patients with fibromyalgia have had mixed results. Randomized growth hormone studies demonstrate some improvement in pain and fatigue but do not support routine use. Several other hormonal supplements, including thyroid hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and calcitonin, have been tried anecdotally but are not widely accepted for fibromyalgia treatment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, rigorous data do not support the use of nutritional supplements, herbal medications, guaifenesin, or vitamin therapy. In a few small uncontrolled studies, low-dose naltrexone demonstrated improved inflammation, pain, and function in patients with fibromyalgia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For patients with fibromyalgia and vitamin D deficiency, repletion of vitamin D may reduce pain and improve function. Given the other risks associated with vitamin D deficiency in older adults (eg, falls, osteoporosis), 25-OH vitamin D levels should be checked routinely, not just in those with chronic pain.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is growing interest in the use of cannabinoid molecules for the treatment of chronic pain. Because data from rigorous randomized controlled trials are lacking, treatment recommendations related to medical cannabis are currently informed by clinical experience and uncontrolled studies (see <span class="s1">Table 103-6</span>).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic Therapies</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic therapies for fibromyalgia include cognitive-behavioral techniques, exercise, acupuncture, balneotherapy (ie, bathing), and massage. Systematic review of regular aerobic exercise for fibromyalgia (20 minutes daily, 2–3 times a week) demonstrated improvements in pain, function, aerobic capacity, and well-being. Most therapists recommend individualizing programs based on patient abilities and symptoms. During pain flares, which may occur after physical exertion, exercise and daily routines should be modified but not ceased. Water aerobics may benefit those who have difficulty with traditional physical therapy. The evidence supporting strength training is not as robust as that for aerobic exercise. Strength training is beneficial for fibromyalgia patients who may be deconditioned and up to 30% weaker than control subjects.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Data support the benefits of coupling exercise programs with educational sessions and cognitive-behavioral techniques. Lectures on fibromyalgia and the benefits of exercise improve treatment outcomes. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is useful for fibromyalgia patients who tend to catastrophize their painful symptoms. We have found that CBT performed via telemedicine is an effective option for those who have trouble traveling or wish to avoid in-person appointments. Studies of internet-based CBT for fibromyalgia demonstrate improvements in pain, depression, and patient satisfaction.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mindfulness-based therapy, such as meditation, may improve sleep, symptom severity, and stress. Cognitive approaches to pain management are most useful as part of an interdisciplinary program that includes education and exercise.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Complementary medicine treatments for fibromyalgia may be beneficial.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several randomized controlled trials of acupuncture have shown effectiveness for relieving fibromyalgia symptoms, although none have been performed exclusively in older adults. These data are encouraging, however, given the overall safety of this treatment modality. Mind-body movement techniques such as yoga, qigong, and tai chi are promising as fibromyalgia therapies. Two controlled trials of tai chi for fibromyalgia showed improvements in pain, sleep, and function. Fibromyalgia patients participating in an 8-week yoga program had similar symptomatic improvements compared to those receiving standard care. Weak evidence supports chiropractic treatment, massage therapy, interferential current, and ultrasound to treat fibromyalgia syndrome. Further studies are needed to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">determine the potential impact of all these modalities and identify potential long-term treatment benefits.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment for Refractory Cases</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several factors limit the effectiveness of fibromyalgia treatment, including medication under-prescribing, under-dosing, and/or patient noncompliance. One fibromyalgia study demonstrated that only 31% of patients received at least one medication listed on the ACR treatment guidelines. Those patients treated with appropriate medicines did not necessarily achieve the recommended dose or adhere to the prescribed regimen. Optimal treatment may require combining several medications, which increases the risk of severe side effects. Patients with refractory pain may benefit from consultation with a specialist for medication adjustment, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, or interventional procedures for comorbid pain conditions.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with severe mood disorders are prone to fail traditional treatments and may benefit from psychiatric comanagement.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assessing Response to Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several standardized questionnaires are available to assess response to treatment. One of the most efficient and useful is the 20-question Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), which takes only a few minutes to complete and quantifies physical function, painful symptoms, and emotional well-being specifically in fibromyalgia patients (<span class="s1">Figure 103-3</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FIGURE 103-3. <span class="s5">Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MYOFASCIAL PAIN SYNDROME</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Background and Epidemiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) arises from muscle as well as surrounding fascia and is characterized by the presence of taut bands of skeletal muscle, which may contain palpable nodules (myofascial trigger points [MTrPs]; <span class="s1">Figure 103-4</span>). MPS can be an acute or chronic condition, and the pain is often regional, compared to widespread pain characteristic of fibromyalgia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 103-4. </span>Schematic of a trigger point complex.

MPS may exist alone or in combination with other pain conditions, such as temporomandibular joint dysfunction, visceral pain syndromes, radiculopathy, and fibromyalgia.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While substantial advances have been made, a full understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of MPS and the role of MTrPs in this is still lacking. Several hypotheses have prevailed in providing an explanation for gaps in knowledge of MPS pathophysiology, two of which include the integrated hypothesis and neurogenic hypothesis. According to the integrated hypothesis, MPS arises from direct (eg, whiplash, muscle injury) or indirect (eg, through muscle overuse or misuse) muscle trauma. This leads to a release of proinflammatory substances that maintain the perception of pain, as well as a dysfunctional motor endplate that ultimately leads to a group of contraction knots in the muscle, forming an MTrP. A traumatic event itself can additionally open ion channels along the membranes of free nerve endings, resulting in cation influx and subsequent excessive, persistent nociceptor depolarization. The neurogenic hypothesis accounts for the occurrence of MPS and MTrPs in patients with no signs of muscle trauma but suffer from visceral or somatic diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, and osteoarthritis, deemed as the <b>primary pathology</b>.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The primary pathology leads to the constant activation of afferent nociceptors, which connect to the thinly myelinated (group III) and unmyelinated (group IV) nerve fibers that synapse onto dorsal horn neurons in the spinal cord, thereby initiating the process of persistent nociceptive bombardment, leading to central and peripheral sensitization. Central sensitization, a core concept of the neurogenic hypothesis, involves neuroplastic changes in the dorsal horn, resulting in sensitized dorsal horn neurons, apoptosis of inhibitory neurons, operation of previously ineffective synapses, and the expansion of receptive fields to nearby segments in the spinal cord. Several biochemicals such as calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P are released antidromically by dorsal root ganglion via the activated nociceptors in the periphery, leading to neurogenically mediated inflammation. Surrounding alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord are also</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">excited, leading to the formation of an MTrP. Other hypotheses that emphasize dysfunctional recruitment of muscle fibers, such as prolonged contraction periods of small fibers due to submaximal loads (Cinderella hypothesis) or decreased relaxation times for postural muscles working in “shifts” (Shift hypothesis), have been proposed as well. <span class="s1">Table 103-8 </span>expands on the underlying mechanisms elucidated by the prevailing hypotheses on MPS pathogenesis.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 103-8 <span class="s3">■ </span>THEORIES OF MTRP PATHOGENESIS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Despite being distinct conditions, both chronic MPS and fibromyalgia share the process of central sensitization as part of their underlying pathophysiology. Many researchers have proposed a role for MTrPs in initiating and maintaining the chronic, widespread pain found in patients with fibromyalgia. However, several studies have shown that not all patients with fibromyalgia present with MTrPs, casting doubt upon the need for active MTrPs to drive both syndromes. Further, most patients presenting with active MTrPs report regional pain that may or may not refer to other areas, but they do not report widespread pain characteristic of fibromyalgia. Nevertheless, deactivation of MTrPs should be incorporated as part of the treatment plan for the patients with fibromyalgia that also have MTrPs.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MPS may occur in virtually any body location, and the accompanying pain may be relatively discrete or cover a large area, spreading from the MTrP. MPS can present abruptly due to acute overload, exercise (overexercise, improper body mechanics that can cause muscle sprain and strain), direct trauma, and chilling (exposure to cold temperatures especially when the muscle is fatigued). MPS also can present gradually due to chronic overload from poor posture, stress, and overuse of muscles while performing work activities using improper body mechanics that can lead to muscle fatigue, sustained muscular contraction in a shortened position, and repetitive stress injuries. It can also manifest secondary to visceral, viral, metabolic, and endocrine diseases, arthritic joints, nutritional deficiencies, anxiety, and emotional distress. We commonly treat older adults with myofascial low back pain that is perpetuated by multiple coexisting factors such as anxiety, leg length inequality, axial spondylosis, and spinal malalignment.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taking the History</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with MPS may use a variety of pain descriptors—dull, aching, sharp, stabbing, burning, etc. Factors that commonly exacerbate pain in these patients are: (1) excessive physical activity, (2) firm pressure over the painful muscle, (3) cold exposure, (4) psychological stress, and (5) acute illness (eg, viral infection). Those that tend to alleviate pain include: (1) mild activity, (2) gentle stretching, (3) gentle pressure (eg, massage), (4) moist heat, and (5) a brief rest period following activity. Common accompanying neurologic and motor signs and symptoms include weakness,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">paresthesias, changes in gait, limitations in range of motion, and autonomic phenomena, such as piloerection, sweating, and temperature changes. As with other chronic pain disorders, changes in appetite, mood, sleep, and cognitive function can occur.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span style=" color: #B8422E;">Diagnosing Myofascial Pain: Performing the Physical Examination </span>Diagnosing MPS requires an accurate physical examination that relies on palpation and identification of (1) taut bands—groups of taut muscle fibers extending from MTrPs to the muscle attachments, (2) exquisitely tender, hyperirritable nodules (MTrP) in taut bands (note that taut bands may not always contain MTrPs), and (3) reproduction of the patient’s spontaneous pain with sustained pressure that may radiate distal to the MTrP (<span class="s1">Figure 103- 5</span>). MTrPs may be latent (ie, painful only upon compression) or active (ie, spontaneously painful). Latent MTrPs may occur in a muscle group contralateral to the site of pain because of a compensatory response. Active MTrPs are those that are responsible for clinical symptoms. In addition to pain with compression of MTrPs, a “jump sign” may be elicited—a pain behavior response that may include verbal as well as nonverbal expression (eg, crying out, grimacing, withdrawing). The examiner may also appreciate a <i>local twitch response </i>(LTR), which is an involuntary, transient contraction of a taut band that traverses a MTrP and occurs in response to stimulation of the MTrP (eg, with needling or snapping palpation).</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 103-5. <span class="s5">Schematic of referred pain patterns.

Before examining the painful muscles, a general physical examination including comprehensive musculoskeletal, neurologic, and mobility examinations must be performed. These examinations must be carried out with an eye toward identifying abnormalities that create muscular dysfunction. Examples in the musculoskeletal examination include decreased motor strength, abnormal muscle tone, decreased range of motion of the hips, knees, cervical spine, and shoulders; congenital or acquired deformities such as scoliosis;</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">kyphosis; and functional or actual leg length discrepancy.

Patients with chronic MPS commonly have reduced skin movement over the involved region. After palpating the skin, the muscles should be examined. MTrPs are associated with the finding of a “nodule.” The MTrP may be large and easily palpable or small and difficult to identify; regardless, the muscle should be palpated thoroughly to search for the area of greatest tenderness. Sweeping hand motion is needed to appreciate taut bands and better elicits the radiating pain that is a pathognomonic feature of MTrPs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While physical examination remains the procedure of choice for diagnosing MPS, it is difficult to standardize, and a number of other techniques have been evaluated. Intramuscular needling, surface electromyography-guided assessment, infrared thermography, ultrasound imaging, elastography, color Doppler, and laser Doppler flowmetry have been examined but all have drawbacks, and none is routinely used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of MPS.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">COMMON MYOFASCIAL PAIN SYNDROMES IN ADULTS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Common presentations of MPS include cervicogenic headaches, piriformis MPS, trapezius MPS (sometimes associated with “tension neckache”), pseudotrochanteric bursitis, upper and lower back pain, and postherpetic pain. These syndromes are discussed below.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cervicogenic Headache</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cervicogenic headaches are characterized by neck and pericranial pain and are often associated with structural abnormalities of the cervical spine, including osteoarthritis and facet arthrosis. Typically, cervicogenic headaches are unilateral in location and range from moderate to severe in intensity. While cervicogenic headaches lack the pulsating quality of migraine headaches, they may have migraine-associated features such as photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Triggers include specific neck postures and movements especially in extension, extension with rotation toward the side of pain, on applying digital pressure to the involved facet regions, over the ipsilateral greater occipital nerve, or pressure applied to the cervical spine. Palpation of these neck muscles including paraspinal muscles, suboccipital muscles, and trapezius also may produce pain, which usually radiates through the head and may extend to the ipsilateral shoulder.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MTrPs are usually found in the suboccipital, cervical, and shoulder musculature, and can also refer pain to the head when manually or physically stimulated. There are no neurologic findings of cervical radiculopathy, though the patient might report scalp paresthesia or dysesthesia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Making the diagnosis for cervicogenic headaches may be difficult especially if structural lesions of the cervical spine are not present. A careful history and examination that clearly implicate the cervical spine and its musculature as the sources of the pain are essential for diagnosis. Diagnostic imaging such as radiography, MRI, and computed tomography (CT) myelography can be used as supportive diagnostic tools. Zygapophyseal joint, cervical nerve, or medial branch blockades are used to confirm the diagnosis of cervicogenic headache and may predict effective treatment modalities.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deep Gluteal Pain Syndrome</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When MPS occurs in the pelvic and buttock regions, the resulting pain and associated limitations in muscle function may mimic that of sciatica. The piriformis muscle originates from the pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts into the medial side of the upper end of the greater trochanter. The fibers of the sciatic nerve course through the piriformis. Piriformis syndrome describes the occurrence of sciatica in association with piriformis MPS that results from nerve entrapment by the myofascial taut bands in the piriformis. Patients with piriformis MPS describe intense gluteal discomfort. Because the piriformis</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">acts to externally rotate the thigh at the hip joint, patients with piriformis MPS sometimes demonstrate external rotation of the leg when standing or laying supine. Palpation of the piriformis can be performed with the patient standing or laying supine. The technique recommended for examining the patient in the supine position is described in <span class="s1">Table 103-10</span>. Piriformis MPS may involve the lower back, buttock, and posterior thigh. Typically, this form of MPS is increased by sitting, standing, and walking.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox"

style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The gluteus minimus is another muscle in which MPS symptoms may mimic sciatica, and, therefore, this muscle should be carefully examined. The fibers of this fan-shaped muscle extend from the outer surface of the pelvis and converge onto a tendon, which is attached to the anterior surface of the greater trochanter. The gluteus minimus fibers work with the gluteus medius to abduct the thigh during extension and stabilize the pelvis during ambulation. Patients with MPS arising from the gluteus minimus typically complain of hip pain during ambulation, often present with a limp, and may also have trouble rising from a sitting position. Because the gluteus minimus is the deepest of the gluteal muscles, it may be difficult for the examiner to palpate taut bands. However, if the patient lays in the supine position or on their side and relaxes the gluteal muscles, MTrPs may be located by identifying the areas of greatest localized tenderness. Palpation of MTrPs in the gluteus minimus may also induce a thigh jerk.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trapezius MPS</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The trapezius is a large muscle; as a result, associated MPS can have a number of presentations. The fibers originate from the occiput, the ligamentum nuchae, and the vertebral spinous processes of the seventh cervical vertebra and all of the 12 thoracic vertebrae. They insert onto the distal third of the clavicle, the acromion, and the length of the spine of the scapula. The upper fibers elevate the scapula, the middle fibers pull the scapula medially, and the lower fibers pull the medial border of the scapula downward. The upper and lower fibers also assist the serratus anterior muscle in rotating the scapula when the arm is raised above the head.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with trapezius MPS typically do not complain of limitations in movement, but full rotation of the head and neck to the opposite side is often painful, and lateral bending contralaterally may be restricted. Radiating pain patterns vary according to the trapezius fibers that contain MTrPs (ie, upper, middle, or lower). MTrPs that occur in the upper trapezius may cause pain that radiates up the posterolateral part of the neck to the mastoid process, causing so-called “tension neckache.” Sometimes this pain may radiate to the angle of the jaw and/or the temple and back of the orbit. Dizziness also may occur. MTrPs of the middle fibers of the trapezius may be associated with a superficial burning pain very close to the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and the third thoracic vertebrae or with aching on the top of the shoulder or acromion process. MTrPs of the lower fibers of the trapezius,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">typically located along the lower border of the muscle, may refer pain to the high paracervical spinal musculature, the mastoid and the acromion, as well as aching and tenderness of the suprascapular region. Perpetuating factors include anything that causes abnormal biomechanics of the upper body such as a whiplash injury or prolonged computer work in an ergonomically unfriendly workspace.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Levator Scapulae MPS</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The levator scapulae muscle extends from the upper medial border of the scapula to the transverse processes of the first four cervical vertebrae. The levator scapulae muscle, in conjunction with the other shoulder muscles, has an important action in stabilizing and moving the scapula and is associated with movement of the shoulder. Levator scapulae pain could be at the angle of the neck, the medial border of the scapula, or out to the posterior aspect of the shoulder joint. It causes restriction of neck movements and pain on stretching the levator scapulae muscle, such as with contralateral bending and rotation of neck. Tenderness is maximal over the angle of the neck along the line of the muscle and most prominent close to attachment at medial border of scapula. It is often precipitated by a prolonged abnormal position and with neck rotation.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Upper and Lower Back Pain</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These syndromes may be caused by MPS in the thoracolumbar paraspinal musculature. Numerous muscles constitute the paraspinal group, including superficial and deep muscles. The superficial group is collectively referred to as the erector spinae and is the largest muscular mass of the back. It originates from the sacrum, the iliac crest, and the spinous processes of most of the lumbar and the last two thoracic vertebrae, and inserts into the ribs, the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, and mastoid process. The deep group comprises the semispinalis, multifidus, and rotatores. The primary function of the paraspinal musculature is spinal extension. Patients with parathoracic MPS may experience pain that radiates to the region of the scapula or more medially, and sometimes to the anterior lower chest; patients with paralumbar MPS may experience pain that radiates to the buttocks or lower abdomen. Precipitation of MPS may be caused by sudden muscular overload (eg, when lifting objects using poor body mechanics) or associated with a vertebral compression fracture. Multiple</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">vertebral compression fractures may also accumulate to cause hyperkyphosis and associated muscular strain. Physical examination typically reveals diminished spinal range of motion.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Upper and lower back pain in older adults often relates to the presence of axial spondylosis. This spondylosis causes aberrant neuronal input by injuring spinal nerves, disrupting generation of neurotrophic factors, and resulting in muscle shortening and pain. This condition, formally described by Chan Gunn et al., is referred to as neuropathic MPS. Axial spondylosis is ubiquitous in older adults; thus, it is not surprising that MPS commonly occurs in older adults with axial arthritis, even in the absence of frank radiculopathy (eg, MPS of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius in patients with cervical spondylosis).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Techniques used to examine the lower back to identify MTrPs and associated perpetuating factors are described in <span class="s1">Table 103-10</span>. Treatment of postural abnormalities is an important component of treating paraspinal MP. Physical therapy geared toward strengthening of core muscles is a key component of treatment, not only for the pain itself, but also for reducing the risk of future vertebral compression fractures.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pseudotrochanteric bursitis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This syndrome is caused by MPS that involves the tensor fasciae latae (TFL) muscle. The TFL originates from the outer edge of the iliac crest between the anterior superior iliac spine and iliac tubercle and inserts into the iliotibial tract. It assists the gluteus maximus in maintaining the knee in extension when a person stands and also flexes the hip. Patients with TFL MPS experience pain in the region of the hip and lateral thigh, sometimes extending to the knee along the iliotibial band. The pattern of pain radiation is sometimes confused with trochanteric bursitis and is referred to as pseudotrochanteric bursitis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients may also complain of poor sitting tolerance, difficulty walking rapidly, and laying on the involved side. They may also have difficulty laying on the opposite side unless a pillow is placed between the knees because of the tight iliotibial band. Physical examination may reveal restricted hip extension and adduction and TFL MTrPs. When standing, patients with TFL MPS tend to maintain the hip in slight flexion. Other disorders that should be considered in the differential diagnosis include L4 radiculopathy and meralgia paresthetica.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Postherpetic MPS</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is likely caused by a combination of axial spondylosis and the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) mainly in older adults. Both VZV and spondylosis-related MPS sensitize dorsal horn neurons and contribute to</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">postherpetic neuralgia. We hypothesize that a spinal nerve already vulnerable from spondylosis that has caused muscle shortening may be particularly prone to the generation of MPS following an acute insult such as VZV. The myofascial pathology may then further exacerbate neuropathic pain by entrapping the spinal nerves as they course through the taut bands of the muscles. This results in a feedback loop.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">MPS pathology may also develop in the setting of postherpetic neuralgia as a result of guarding behavior. The pain associated with reactivation of VZV can cause patients to move their body in ways to protect the painful area. When this type of behavior occurs over a prolonged period of time, muscles may develop contraction knots that are characteristic of MPS. The mechanism by which postherpetic neuralgia occurs may be complicated by the development of MPS pathology. Treatment of both the MPS pathology and the neuropathy may be needed to afford optimal pain relief.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction Syndromes</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since muscles cover virtually the entire body, any region may be affected by MPS. Thus, MPS should always be included in the practitioner’s list of differential diagnoses for regional pain syndromes. Furthermore, the practitioner must be aware that MPS may occur in response to visceral disease; when myofascial dysfunction is identified in the abdomen and pelvis, the possibility of underlying visceral pathology must be kept in mind. Sometimes, even after the visceral pathology has been eradicated, MPS may persist, which further complicates evaluation and treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Some less common causes of MPS include pelvic floor myofascial dysfunction causing chronic pelvic pain in both men and women, pelvic myofascial dysfunction causing urologic pain (eg, interstitial cystitis and the urgency-frequency syndrome), masticatory myofascial dysfunction causing toothache, abdominal wall myofascial dysfunction causing chronic abdominal pain (eg, following abdominal surgery or a gastrointestinal illness), intercostal myofascial dysfunction causing postthoracotomy pain, and TMJ dislocation/arthritis causing jaw locking and severe pain.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As noted earlier in this chapter, myofascial dysfunction is not always associated with complaints of pain (ie, in the case of latent MTrPs). For example, masticatory myofascial dysfunction has been associated with tinnitus and myofascial dysfunction of the trapezius with dizziness. Cervical myofascial dysfunction may also be associated with dizziness, a sense of imbalance and tinnitus, and treatment (as outlined below) may alleviate these symptoms. For a more extensive discussion of these and other MPS and dysfunction syndromes, as well as diagrams of common MTrPs and their radiating pain patterns, the reader is referred to Travell and Simons’ <i>Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual</i>. Another less detailed but very useful introductory text that practitioners may want to consider is <i>Trigger Point Therapy for Myofascial Pain: The Practice of Informed Touch</i><a href="http://www.InnerTraditions.com/" class="s13" target="_blank">, 2005, edited by Finando and Finando; </a><a href="http://www.InnerTraditions.com/" class="a" target="_blank">www.InnerTraditions.com</a><a href="http://www.InnerTraditions.com/" class="s13" target="_blank">.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TREATMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An overview of MPS treatment is provided in <span class="s1">Table 103-11 </span>and <span class="s1">Figure 103-</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6<span class="p">. Effective treatment of MPS involves a three-pronged approach. First, it is important to identify and address perpetuating factors that maintain the pain/muscle dysfunction, and precipitating factors that initiate the syndrome. In the older adult, these may lie along a continuum. Second, the MTrPs should be treated. Third, muscle resilience should be addressed through a home exercise program. Treatments should focus not only on resolving the MTrP but also on the health of the surrounding environment (eg, fascia, connective tissue) that may contribute to MPS. In addition, the presence of biochemical markers of pain are very important. This thinking has led clinicians to try to reduce the size of the MTrP, correct underlying contributors to the pain, and restore the normal working relationship between the muscles and surrounding connective tissues of the affected functional units. There are two phases for effective treatment: a pain-control phase and a deep conditioning phase. During the pain-control phase, MTrPs are deactivated, improving blood circulation, decreasing pathological nociceptive activity, and eliminating the abnormal biomechanical force patterns.

Lower back pain, for example, could be perpetuated by lumbar spondylosis, degenerative scoliosis, and hip arthritis. The physical factors that <i>precipitate </i>MPS may be overt such as a fall with direct trauma to the piriformis that causes piriformis syndrome or may be more subtle, such as a flare of knee osteoarthritis that alters gait and initiates TFL pain.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Psychological stressors may also precipitate flares of MPS or act as perpetuating factors.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The correction of perpetuating factors is arguably one of the most important aspects of MPS treatment. Even if precipitating factors are addressed, the presence of perpetuating factors may reactivate the patient’s original MPS complaint, preventing resolution of pain and dysfunction.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perpetuating factors typically persist over time, and often require behavioral and lifestyle adjustments. As part of the search for perpetuating factors, the practitioner should identify any contributing vitamin deficiencies (eg, B<span class="s11">1</span>, B<span class="s11">6</span>,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">B<span class="s11">12</span>, C, D, folic acid) or hormonal imbalances. Repetitive movements that contribute to muscular dysfunction, such as those in wheelchair users and computer operators, also should be identified. Proper body mechanics during</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">sitting, standing, walking, and sleeping should be taught by an occupational</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or physical therapist and efforts to modify repetitive movements and/or other mechanical stressors should be instituted.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients who spend prolonged periods resting in static positions (eg, sitting, reclining) may perpetuate their MPS through inactivity. Efforts should be made to incorporate intervals of light movement or stretching if the patient is able to tolerate such activities in order to minimize overuse of small muscle fibers (ie, the Cinderella hypothesis).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Direct or indirect acute trauma should also be identified. For example, if a patient has a sudden leg length discrepancy following total hip replacement, prescription of a shoe lift may be helpful. For patients with long-standing leg length discrepancy, a shoe lift may disrupt the patient’s established compensatory strategies and lead to mobility dysfunction and falls. In these patients, the muscle dysfunction of the pelvis and lower extremities should be first addressed before considering an orthotic device.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Abnormal posture should be corrected. For instance, in older adults with severe kyphosis related to multiple vertebral compression fractures, restoration of normal posture may not be possible and prescription of a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">walker to unload the spine (ie, alleviate strain on the lower back musculature) should be considered.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">To the extent that psychological stressors such as anxiety and depression are playing a role in perpetuating MPS, cognitive behavioral therapy and/or other nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments may be useful.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vitamin D deficiency also should be identified and treated given its association with musculoskeletal pain, although randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in patients with MPS have not been performed. For patients who do not respond to these approaches in combination with MTrP treatment, referral to an interdisciplinary pain clinic can be considered.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treating MTrPs</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The second prong of MPS treatment is to directly treat MTrPs. The goal of treating MTrPs is to <i>deactivate </i>them, and this can be accomplished using noninvasive and/or invasive approaches, listed in <span class="s1">Table 103-11</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Oral medications are often considered as potential supplements to the aforementioned treatments for MPS, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), benzodiazepines, TCAs, and thiocolchicoside, but these generally should be avoided in older adults because of their risk profile. We have had some success with low-dose gabapentin (eg, 300 mg twice a day) for the treatment of neuropathic MPS in patients with cervical spondylosis and MPS in the paracervical musculature. Topical medications such as diclofenac and lidocaine patches as well as capsaicin and EMLA cream also may have limited efficacy. Medications that target perpetuating factors such as anxiety and insomnia should be considered routinely.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Home Exercise Program</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The third prong of MPS treatment is maintaining muscular health through a home exercise program. Many factors that contribute to MPS in older adults cannot be eliminated (eg, axial spondylosis, scoliosis); therefore, active pain self-management is key to sustaining improvement. Patients should be encouraged to maintain an active lifestyle and incorporate a cardiovascular and aerobic fitness program into their routine. Aerobic exercise such as water aerobics may reduce generalized pain and the number of MTrPs, whereas isometric strengthening can increase pain tolerance by providing additional sustenance to affected muscle groups. Pain flares can be prevented</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by educating patients regarding exercise that includes targeted muscular stretching and eliminating movements that may perpetuate or precipitate myofascial dysfunction. Self-massage also is effective for MPS self- management that involves applying pressure in a rolling motion through the MTrPs. These methods initially should be performed under the supervision of a qualified (ie, one with specific expertise in MPS management) physical therapist, chiropractor, or massage therapist before transitioning into a home exercise program.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Treatments</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A number of other treatments have been tried for MPS such as repetitive magnetic stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), biofeedback, massage, ultrasound, hydrocortisone/diclofenac phonophoresis, laser therapy, traditional Chinese and Japanese acupuncture, nerve blocks, and cervical spine dorsal root rhizotomy for the treatment of cervicogenic headaches. The quality of evidence at the present time cannot recommend for or against any of these treatments.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CONCLUSION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fibromyalgia and MPS are common causes of chronic pain in older adults. Fibromyalgia is a central sensitivity syndrome with patients demonstrating increased sensitivity to a variety of stimuli, especially pain. While the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia needs further study, there seems to be a genetic predisposition and a clear familial aggregation. Lower levels of central neurotransmitters and nociceptive chemicals are believed to be involved with fibromyalgia pathogenesis. Data on the pathophysiology of MPS support both central and peripheral sensitization. The biochemical milieu of muscles affected by MPS is distinct from that of normal musculature.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For both fibromyalgia and MPS, individualized approaches to treatment are recommended. Medications alone do not typically improve function, but may improve mood, sleep, and pain. Stretching and local modalities as well as identification and treatment of perpetuating factors should be considered first line for MPS and aerobic exercise is a key component of the approach to treating fibromyalgia. Interdisciplinary treatment programs that include education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and exercise may be effective for both fibromyalgia and MPS. Further studies are needed to advance treatment for older adult patients with these disorders, reduce the associated risk of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">functional compromise and unnecessary health care expenditure, and improve overall quality of life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Bell T, Trost Z, Buelow MT, et al.

The most important risk factor for infection in seniors is the accumulation of comorbid disease with age (eg, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, vascular disease, heart failure, functional decline, and immobility). These conditions alter immune response, reduce blood flow, impair mucociliary clearance mechanisms, and alter drug distribution and metabolism. Cognitive decline and comorbid illness can alter presentation of illness, delay diagnosis, or reduce adherence to medical regimens. Comorbid disease also reduces physiologic reserve and thus is an important predictor for adverse outcomes when infection occurs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While comorbidities substantially influence the risk and outcome of infection, the immune response itself—both innate and adaptive immunity— changes with advancing age (detailed in <span class="s1">Figure 104-1 </span>and <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 3</span>).

While it is clear that age itself is associated with reduced responses to vaccines as early as the third or fouth decade (eg, human papillomavirus vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine), the most critical deficits appear later in life.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disability-adjusted life-years lost due to vaccine preventable illness shows a major inflection point at about age 70. Specific vaccine formulations and strategies developed to overcome immune senescence include higher antigen concentration (eg, high-dose influenza vaccine), adding specific adjuvant to a protein subunit vaccine (eg, zoster subunit vaccine), and most recently the mRNA and viral carrier strategies employed to produce the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The adjuvanted zoster and mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">strategies resulted in remarkably enhanced efficacy, greater than or equal to 90% for most seniors and even more than 80% in frail older adults, with tolerable increases in reactogenicity/side effects.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Extrinsic Factors</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major external dynamics impact infection risk and outcomes in older adults. Physiologic and medication-induced effects on appetite, taste, and absorption/clearance, as well as inconsistent access to nutritious food sources, can result in protein–energy malnutrition (PEM). Thirty to sixty percent of adults older than 65 years admitted to the hospital have PEM, which is linked to delayed wound healing, pressure ulcer formation, risk of pneumonia and other nosocomial infections, longer hospital stays and increased mortality. In the outpatient setting, even mild PEM (ie, seniors with a serum albumin of 3.0–3.5 g/dL) has reduced vaccine responses. Despite this, high protein/high calorie nutritional supplements have not consistently shown benefit for preventing infection or boosting immune responses.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Specific micronutrient deficiencies in older adults are also linked to infection risk (eg, vitamin D deficiency and risk for tuberculosis (TB), <i>Clostridiodes difficile </i>and SARS-CoV-2 infection). Patients identified with true micronutrient deficiencies should receive supplementation to reverse the deficiency. However, in otherwise healthy adults with normal or even “insufficient” (low but not to the level of true deficiency) vitamin levels, very thin data support supplementation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Additional “social determinants of health” combine to influence infection risk in seniors. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with higher rates of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and invasive pneumococcal infections in older adults, perhaps due to reduced access to care, but other factors are in play as well. Low SES is associated with increased exposure to pollution and tobacco exposure, infectious agents (eg, grandparents raising young children more often), and poor nutrition, as well as an increased rates of comorbid disease (eg, asthma, diabetes).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Living condition/setting also plays a major role for many seniors. Long- term care (ie, nursing home) residents have a particularly high incidence of respiratory, genitourinary, gastrointestinal (GI), and skin infections, and unique infection control challenges exist in the long-term care setting. Close contact between residents and staff plays a key role in the spread of respiratory infections (eg, influenza, RSV) or infections transmitted by</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">contact (eg, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes, C difficile</i>). The setting of frail older adults in a confined space can lead to severe outbreaks with high mortality rates; never was this more evident than in the recent COVID-19 pandemic in which long-term care facilities were a major site of transmission and mortality.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PRESENTATION OF INFECTION IN SENIORS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even serious, life-threatening infection often presents atypically in older adults. Exacerbations of underlying illness or nonspecific declines in function or mentation may lead older adult patients to seek medical attention for symptoms related to comorbidity rather than infection. The predominant indicator of infection, fever, is absent in up to one-third of older adults with serious infection. Older adults, particularly frail older adults, have lower baseline body temperatures than the “normal” 98.6°F (37°C). Further, temperature increases in response to inflammatory stimuli are dampened with advanced age, and the combination of lower basal temperature and a blunted response makes it less likely that an older adult will reach the definition of fever (≥ 100.4°F/38°C) delaying diagnosis and treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Cognitive impairment may also contribute to the difficulty of diagnosing infection in older adults. While a high index of suspicion for infection is warranted in such patients, clinicians should be cautioned to thoughtfully order tests and interpret results carefully. For example, subtle symptoms often lead to overdiagnosis when ill-advised cultures identify colonization (eg, asymptomatic bacteriuria) rather than true infection. Those positive cultures are assumed to be causing the nonspecific symptoms, when dehydration, medication changes, and other factors may truly be the cause.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Further, the utility of culture data in some situations is very poor (eg, swab cultures of skin surface wounds or urine cultures when catheters are present), leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment (see specific syndromes below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">PRINCIPLES OF ANTIBIOTIC MANAGEMENT IN SENIORS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antimicrobial Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drug distribution, metabolism, excretion, and interactions change with age and comorbid illness. Antibiotic dose adjustments are needed commonly in seniors due to reduced renal function or increased sensitivity to side effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Polypharmacy can make antibiotic selection and dosing particularly challenging due to drug interactions. These factors often lead clinicians to the maxim of “start low, go slow” when treating geriatric patients. However, for antibiotics, this is <i>not </i>an appropriate strategy. Early, therapeutic antibiotic levels are particularly important in older adults—much more important than in young adults—perhaps due to the slower initial innate immune response previously discussed and poor physiologic reserve. Outcomes of serious infection in seniors depend on reaching adequate drug levels quickly, particularly for antibiotics with a concentration-dependent mechanism of action (eg, fluoroquinolones), so aggressive first-dose strategies are appropriate (eg, loading doses) in serious infection. Slowed gastric motility, decreased absorption, increased adipose tissue, and coadministration of other drugs can also decrease blood levels of antimicrobials in older adults. Adherence may be limited by poor cognitive function, inadequate understanding of the drug regimen, impaired hearing or vision, and polypharmacy. Studies suggest that any regimen requiring greater than twice daily dosing is associated with reduced adherence rates. Finally, antibiotics can only reach tissues that are well-perfused; poor blood flow due to macro- or microvascular disease can impair drug delivery and lead to clinical failures even when the organism is susceptible.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Outpatient Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) is commonly used for infections that occur in older adults (eg, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, PJ infection), but this modality is underused in older adults in the United States. Instead, patients are often admitted to nursing homes to achieve insurance/Medicare “coverage.” Medicare Part D, however, does cover OPAT at home, although navigating the system to obtain reimbursement for both the antibiotic and the necessary supplies/home health assistance for drug administration takes considerable skill. OPAT is safe and effective therapy in seniors that have adequate support and monitoring and can often avoid long- term care admission. In addition, oral regimens with high bioavailability and reliable pharmacokinetics can be used in specific situations—an infectious disease consultation may help avoid the need for long-term IV therapy.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antibiotic and Culture Stewardship</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Older adults, particularly long-term care residents, have some of the highest rates of multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) colonization and infection.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with indwelling devices (eg, urinary catheters, G-tubes) and those with marked functional impairment are at highest risk. Widespread antibiotic use in long-term care is sometimes viewed as inevitable, but it can be studied and unnecessary use greatly reduced. Residents in long-term care facilities with higher rates of antibiotic use are more susceptible to antibiotic-related adverse events <i>even if the individual resident doesn’t receive antibiotics</i>. Just being in a high-risk environment increases the risk of adverse consequences (<i>C difficile </i>infection [CDI], non-CDI diarrhea, MDRO colonization and infection, allergic reactions, or general medication adverse events) (<span class="s1">Figure 104-2</span>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 104-2. </span>Percent of long-term care residents experiencing antibiotic-related adverse events with potential for indirect harm (<i>C difficile</i>, diarrhea/gastroenteritis, multidrug-resistant organism infection) or any antibiotic-related adverse event (including antibiotic allergic reaction and general adverse medication event).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has an excellent resource center on antibiotic stewardship in long-term care facilities (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/longtermcare/prevention/antibiotic-stewardship.html)" class="a" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/longtermcare/prevention/antibiotic-stewardship.html</a>). One of the most effective approaches is culture stewardship—limiting</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unnecessary cultures (eg, swab cultures of pressure ulcers, urine cultures with indwelling catheters). Cultures from pressure ulcers and urine in the presence of an indwelling catheter will <i>always </i>be positive, but the information does not correlate with infection. Culture stewardship, using preset criteria to obtain cultures, can markedly reduce antibiotic use in this setting.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antibiotics at the End of Life</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since 1998, the American Medical Association Council of Ethical and Judicial Affairs has included antibiotics as “life-sustaining” treatment to be discussed as part of advanced directive and end-of-life care. Many clinicians, however, feel antibiotics are not sufficiently “invasive” to warrant discussion in scope of care orders. While every clinical situation is unique, and no comprehensive recommendation made for withholding antibiotics in the terminally ill, it seems prudent to include antibiotic administration in advanced directives just as one would for any medical intervention such as surgery, mechanical ventilation, or administration of food/fluids. Antibiotics may be palliative in some situations (vs prolongation of life) when symptoms are due to infection itself and readily reversible with treatment—an excellent example is severe, painful oral or esophageal candidiasis. Otherwise, limiting diagnostic testing for infection in palliative care situations is prudent when it will not alter longer-term outcomes or provide symptom relief that cannot be achieved with other measures (eg, antipyretics).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SPECIFIC CLINICAL SYNDROMES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A complete review of all the clinical infectious syndromes experienced by older adults is beyond the scope of this chapter, and several chapters in this textbook cover individual conditions in detail. <span class="s1">Table 104-1 </span>provides a summary of treatment for common infections in older adults.

adults older than 65 years versus younger adults primarily due to poor physiologic reserve and multimorbidity in the former. In addition, gram-negative bacilli—usually from GI or genitourinary (GU) sources—are more common in seniors and antibiotic management should emphasize the importance of initially broad coverage. This is particularly true when MDRO risk is high (eg, indwelling device present in a nursing home patient, known MDRO colonization). Early sepsis is very challenging to identify and manage in the nursing home setting because of the nonspecificity of its presentation and lack of resources such as stat labs, intravenous antibiotics, and pharmacy services.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">When older adults survive sepsis they are more likely than young adults to suffer long-term impairment of physical or cognitive function. In one study, seniors surviving sepsis had a risk of moderate to severe cognitive impairment of 6% prehospitalization, but nearly 17% after hospitalization.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those same patients also experienced a decrease in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs), and about 40% of those older than 65 years require admission to a long-term care facility versus only 15% in those younger than 65 years.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Infective Endocarditis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fever and leukocytosis in infective endocarditis (IE) are less common (55% and 25%, respectively, in those 65 years and older versus 80% and 60%, respectively, in younger adults). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) sensitivity is lower in older adults due to calcified valves, more turbulent blood flow, and shadows off prosthetic valves (when present).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive and improves the diagnostic yield by 45% in seniors over that of TTE. Native valve IE is typically caused by streptococci and staphylococci in both young and older adults. However, as noted for bacteremia above, GI and GU organisms such as enterococci and gram-negative rods become more common with increasing age, and initial antibiotic treatment may need to be broader until a specific organism is isolated. IE prophylaxis recommendations do not differ based on age.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prosthetic Device Infections</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Infection of implanted prosthetic devices (joints, cardiac pacemakers/heart valves, intraocular lens implants, vascular grafts, etc) is common in older</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adults. Foreign material creates an environment for bacterial biofilms, and bacteria embedded in these biofilms are often more difficult for antibiotics or immune mechanisms to clear. Skin flora—coagulase-negative staphylococci, <i>S aureus </i>and diphtheroids—are the predominate causative organisms for early (&lt; 60 days after implantation) infections. The source is presumably due to contamination of the surgical site or occult bacteremia with skin organisms from incision sites/IV sites. Gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and polymicrobial infection are rare causes of early infection, but can be seen in some situations that increase the risk of occult bacteremia (eg, GU instrumentation). Late (beyond day 60 postimplantation) infections are more likely due to asymptomatic episodes of bacteremia seeding the implant and subject to a wider array of organisms, including GI and GU sources of bacteremia as noted previously, but skin organisms (staphylococci) still predominate. Empirical therapy of prosthetic device infections is NOT recommended unless there is an overt clinical justification (eg, sepsis). In clinically stable patients, there is almost always time to safely obtain cultures without antibiotics—for example in PJ infection—to base treatment on culture data.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Anticipated functional outcomes and patient/infection characteristics determine the approach to prosthetic device infection—particularly PJ infection (<span class="s1">Figure 104-3</span>). Cure may be difficult with the device in place, but in some instances—short duration of symptoms or early after primary implantation—aggressive surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy may result in cure with the device in situ. The highest cure rates are achieved with removal/replacement of the infected implant either in a one- or two-step procedure particularly if the device is unstable or the organism is not highly susceptible to well-absorbed oral antibiotics. However, cure using these methods requires an extended period of very limited mobility that may lead to further functional decline. When future ambulation is not likely even if the infection is cured or life expectancy is relatively short and surgical risk high, it may be reasonable to control the infection initially with joint aspiration and IV antibiotics followed by long-term antibiotic suppression. Thus, clinical judgment is critical in devising a comprehensive plan for therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although many factors may mitigate enthusiasm to attempt cure, age alone should <i>not </i>be a reason to withhold curative therapy—function at baseline and the likely long-term outcome should drive the decision, not age.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 104-3. <span class="s5">Summary of management of prosthetic joint infections based on clinical characteristics, most appropriate strategy, and intended outcome of treatment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Antimicrobial prophylaxis to reduce the risk of device infection around dental, GI, and GU procedures is hotly debated. While recommended for prosthetic heart valves, and by extrapolation vascular grafts, particularly within the first 12 to 24 months after placement, supportive evidence for prophylaxis is thin even in these clinical situations. There is even weaker evidence for prophylaxis in patients with PJs, intracoronary artery stents, and many other less-commonly implanted prostheses. Despite this, the American Dental Association (ADA) recommends “considering” antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with a PJ at “high risk”—defined as PJs placed within 2 years or in immunosuppressed patients (including those with diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, or malnourishment), or in patients with a history of prior joint infection.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gastrointestinal Infections</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Altered transit time, achlorhydria, diverticular disease, immune senescence, altered GI microbiota, and comorbid diseases predispose seniors to GI infection. Diagnosis and management of most GI infections are similar regardless of age; however, a number of aspects deserve further comment.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Viral GI pathogens (eg, norovirus) are common causes of gastroenteritis in older adults and can lead to marked dehydration and/or exacerbation of underlying comorbid disease. Further, such pathogens are commonly the cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in long-term care facilities—even one or two cases in residents or staff should prompt rapid infection control interventions in such settings.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">CDI disproportionately affects older adults and results in greater morbidity and mortality. Asymptomatic carriage of <i>C difficile </i>is not relatively common in seniors; 2% in the community, 10% in community dwellers with outpatient health care exposure, and 20% to 50% in hospital or long-term care settings. Symptomatic CDI occurs in about 15% of asymptomatic carriers after antibiotics. Older adults with CDI are more likely to develop severe sequelae (sepsis, hypotension, renal failure, toxic megacolon), but even mild-moderate CDI can have major consequences in advanced age. The need to use the bathroom six to eight times daily is not trivial for mobility-limited, visually impaired, or demented older adults, and even mild-moderate CDI may result in loss of independence for such seniors.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Guideline-driven therapy for CDI does not differ specifically by age, but the risk of relapse after treatment is much greater in older adults than in those yonger than age 65. Prolonged taper of vancomycin is commonly used in patients who relapse with high rates of success. However, refractory relapse may require fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) that has become standard in recent years. FMT using donated stool or oral capsules of commercially available preparations is safe and effective with success rates of 80% to 90%. Prevention of CDI in high risk, older adults who require another course of antibiotics benefit from passive antibody administration prior to receiving antibiotics. Vancomycin prophylaxis is also be effective.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tuberculosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advanced age is a long-established, major risk factor for clinical tuberculosis. Fever, night sweats, cough, and hemoptysis are less likely to be present than in young adults; older adults are more likely to present with nonspecific symptoms of dizziness, generalized pain, or mental “dullness.” Older adults are more likely to have widespread lung infiltrates, whereas young adults are more likely to have isolated upper lobe infiltrates/cavities, and older adults are more likely to have evidence of malnutrition (ie, reduced serum albumin).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Tuberculin skin test (TST) sensitivity to detect latent infection declines with age. Newer diagnostic tests for tuberculosis (eg, interferon-γ release assay [IFGRA] from blood measured after ex vivo <i>Mycobacterium</i></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><i>tuberculosis </i>antigen exposure) are minimally more sensitive (<span class="s1929">∼ </span>70% for TST vs <span class="s1929">∼ </span>75% for IFGRAs). However, IFGRA requires a single blood draw (rather than a second visit 48 to 72 hours later to assess a TST), does not require two-step testing in nursing home residents, and has greater interrater reliability and specificity than TST. Therefore, most latent tuberculosis testing is now done by IFGRA. The treatment of tuberculosis in older adults does not differ from that of young adults, but drug side effects are more common than in young adults.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fever of Unknown Origin</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FUO is classically defined as temperature more than 101°F (38.3°C) for at least 3 weeks and undiagnosed after 1 week of medical evaluation. The cause of FUO can be determined in about 90% of cases and approximately one-third will have treatable infections, most often intraabdominal abscess, bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, or occult osteomyelitis (see <span class="s1">Table 104- 2</span>). In contrast to young adults, autoimmune disease is a more frequent cause of FUO in adults older than 60 years accounting for nearly one of every four FUOs. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common autoimmune cause of FUO in young adults, is essentially absent in published cohorts of FUO in older adults, and replaced by GCA and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Neoplastic disease accounts for another 20%, most often a result of hematopoietic malignancies (eg, lymphoma and leukemia). Drug fever is a common cause in older adults and deep venous thrombosis with or without recurrent pulmonary emboli occasionally causes the syndrome.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 104-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO) IN OLDER PATIENTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The diagnostic algorithm for older adults is influenced by the age-varied differential diagnosis in FUO. A thorough history and physical examination; basic laboratory evaluations of complete blood counts with differential, serum chemistries and hepatic enzymes, thyroid function studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), IFGRA for TB, HIV serology, creatinine kinase, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urinalysis, chest x-ray, and blood (x3) and urine cultures should begin the search. If initial work-up does not provide a clearer direction, chest/abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) is most likely to provide assistance and is the next suggested test. However, if the ESR is elevated, temporal artery biopsy even in the absence of typical history or objective physical findings should be considered in older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Another potentially valuable modality, <span class="s11">18</span>F-FDG-PET/CT is superior to tagged WBC scans or gallium scans in FUO and its earlier use in the work- up can be cost-effective when one considers the avoidance of other tests.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">This is particularly important in older adults—several small studies estimate</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">18<span class="p">F-FDG uptake in the temporal, maxillary, or vertebral arteries occurs in 64% to 82% of patients with GCA with very high specificity.

Comprehensive immunization recommendations for adults are provided by the CDC by age or comorbid illness category and updated annually (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/" class="a" target="_blank">https://</a><span style=" color: #0000ED;">www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ </span>for the most recent updates).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Immune senescence has presented a major obstacle to effective vaccinations in seniors. However, three recently approved vaccines (high- dose influenza vaccine, adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, and the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines) provide higher protection rates than earlier, standard vaccines—even in frail older adults—outlining future strategies to advance future vaccine development. Another strategy to address immune senescence is to “cocoon” older adults from exposure by immunizing family members, caregivers, and others who regularly come into contact with seniors. This has been demonstrated in many settings (eg, immunizing nursing home staff to protect residents, conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in children reduce pneumonia risk in older adults).</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Active, older adults travel frequently raising additional vaccine issues.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many countries require yellow fever vaccine; however, the live, yellow fever vaccine requires great caution in seniors. Older adults are six times more likely than young adults to experience a serious adverse events after yellow fever vaccine and adults 60 years and older are cautioned to discuss risk/benefit carefully prior to vaccination (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/yf.html)" class="a" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/yf.html</a>). Yellow fever risk in travelers is very low, particularly when travel is limited to urban areas, and a physician’s letter of exemption is often acceptable for countries that require proof of yellow fever vaccination for entry.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/travel" class="s13" target="_blank">Other major issues in traveling seniors include malaria chemoprophylaxis. Side effects are more common for many agents (eg, mefloquine may produce dizziness, change in mental status, and bradycardia or prolonged QT intervals), and coadministration may be difficult in those taking cardiac medications or with significant heart disease. Alternative regimens are available, but recognition of current resistance patterns is critical (see CDC website [</a>www.cdc.gov/travel<span style=" color: #000;">] for up-to-date information). Diarrhea occurs in 25% to 50% of travelers to developing countries. Primary treatment consists of fluid and electrolyte replacement, but antimicrobial therapy with a quinolone is indicated when diarrhea is accompanied by fever or bloody stools or is prolonged. Antimotility agents are safe in this situation when coadministered with antibiotics.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Baghban A, Juthani-Mehta M.

The incidence of pneumonia increases with age and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and health care costs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pneumonia in older adults affects a heterogeneous spectrum of patients; the assessment of clinical, cognitive, functional, and social issues is key to achieving correct ascertainment of most likely pathogens and thus initial antibiotic management, clinical decision making, and subsequent care planning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DEFINITION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pneumonia can be defined from three different points of view: the clinician, researcher, and pathologist. Pneumonia is clinically defined as the combination of symptoms (fever, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain) and signs (hyper- or hypothermia, increased respiratory rate, dullness upon percussion, crackles, wheezing, pleural rub) associated with an opacity (or opacities) on a chest x-ray. In epidemiological or clinical trials, the presence of two or more of these symptoms, one or more of the physical signs, and a new opacity on the chest x-ray not due to other conditions (such as congestive heart failure, vasculitis, pulmonary infarction, drug reactions or atelectasis) is typically required for a diagnosis of pneumonia. From the pathologist point of view, pneumonia is an acute inflammatory process of the lung parenchyma in response to an infectious agent that affects the structures of the distal</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">airways. The pneumonic process can predominantly develop in the alveoli (alveolar pneumonia), the interstitial space (interstitial pneumonia), or both (mixed pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage). Alveolar pneumonia is predominantly exudative inflammation. Interstitial pneumonia is normally referred to as proliferative or productive, with inflammation in the stromal space and production of fibrous tissue, respectively. The histology of pneumonia depends on the state of progression, etiological agent, and host conditions, such as immune deficiency.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Pneumonia can also be defined in terms of the characteristics of the host, place of acquisition, and severity.

It is estimated that pneumonia has an incidence of 2 to 10 cases per 1000 inhabitants per year. The risk is higher in males, and in both sexes increases dramatically with age. According to European and American registries, the incidence of pneumonia is 25 to 40 cases per 1000 inhabitants per year with a mortality rate of 7% to 35% in patients older than 65 years. This increased vulnerability associated with age is presumed to be due to physiologic changes in the immune response that occur during aging and a higher burden of associated chronic diseases that are cumulative with age.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Pneumonia causes more than 4 million annual outpatient visits in the United States. There are more than 1 million hospitalizations due to pneumonia each year and 600,000 occur in adults older than 65 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Between 10% and 20% of hospitalized patients require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The mean length of stay in the hospital is 5 days, and the overall 30-day mortality rate is 23%. Mortality depends on the severity of the pneumonic episode, as well as age and associated risk factors. This ranges from 1% to 2% in young patients without comorbidity, to 25% to 50% in older adults with a severe comorbidity. The 30-day mortality rate is three times higher among those older than 85 years, compared to the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">group of patients aged 65 to 74. In the United States, more than 50,000 deaths per year are attributed to pneumonia and 85% occur in patients older than 65 years. The 30-day readmission rate is approximately 20%. Total cost of care for patients with pneumonia is over 17 billion dollars a year in the United States. The cost of treatment is mainly in seniors as total cost is primarily driven by hospitalization—responsible for 80% of economic resources devoted to this disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The presence of indwelling devices (nasogastric tube, urinary catheter), comorbidity (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, cancers, liver disease, heart disease, renal disease), tobacco use, malnutrition, splenectomy, and age extremes (older patients or children &lt; 5 years) is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. In older adults, other risk factors have also been described, such as swallowing disorders, use of sedatives, and the presence of disability and baseline functional status. Vaccination and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (which may protect by stimulating cough mechanisms) are protective factors.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Summarizing briefly, when compared to young adults, pneumonia in older adults is associated with increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and functional impairment, with a higher percentage of admissions, more often to the ICU, a longer length of hospital stay, and increased use of health resources.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pneumonia is most frequently produced by the microaspiration of flora that colonizes the oropharynx and sinuses. A high percentage of silent oropharyngeal microaspiration has been demonstrated in older adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This microaspiration occurs in up to half of older patients hospitalized for pneumonia. A systematic review showed microaspiration risk factors include male gender, dementia, lung disease (COPD), and administration of certain drugs (antipsychotics, proton pump inhibitors); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use was protective. Taylor et al. simplified aspiration risk factors as the presence of chronic neurologic disorders, esophageal disease, decreased level of consciousness, and history of vomiting.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Other less common forms of infection are (1) direct inhalation of the infectious agent, as with the tubercle bacillus, influenza, and other respiratory viruses and fungi; (2) hematogenous spread, except in the case of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">staphylococcal pneumonia after a viral influenza infection; (3) contiguous spread of infection from a subphrenic abscess, esophageal rupture, or other anatomic breach; and (4) iatrogenic contamination (eg, through an endotracheal tube).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The probability of infection depends on the aspiration volume, the virulence of the bacteria and the host’s defense mechanisms. Several factors have been described as causing a higher risk of pneumonia in older adults, such as physiologic changes associated with age, increase and severity of underlying diseases, and an increase in the number of hospitalizations. Age- associated changes in the respiratory system are a decrease in rib cage mobility and respiratory muscle strength, increases in “dead” space and residual volume, a decrease in the sensitivity of the respiratory centers to hypoxemia and hypercapnia, and modifications in the airway receptors.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changes in the immune system associated with aging, or immunosenescence, consist of a progressive reduction in the immune response that affects all components of both the innate and adaptive immune system (see <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 3</span>). The most significant changes are alterations in mucosal barriers, favoring invasion by microorganisms; reduction of native T cells and the differentiation and proliferation of T cells; alteration of T-cell subtypes (↓CD4+/↑CD8+); B-lymphocyte deficiency and impaired production of specific antibodies; and cytokine imbalance (↓ IL-2, IL-1, and IFN and ↑ IL- 4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF). These modifications involve a greater risk for infection and rapid progression of infection, a poor response to vaccines, a lesser subjective sensation of shortness of breath, and increased susceptibility to bronchial and respiratory failure.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ETIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A microbiologic diagnosis is generally difficult to establish, even when complex and invasive diagnostic methods are employed. The etiology is usually monomicrobial and, overall, the most common agent is <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae </i>(20%–65%) and should always be taken into account when choosing initial antibiotic coverage. With an increase in age, there is a reduction in the frequency of microorganisms conventionally known as <i>atypical </i>(<i>Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, and</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chlamydophila pneumoniae<span class="p">), and there is a relative increase in the incidence of pneumonia due to </span>Haemophilus influenzae <span class="p">and gram-negative bacilli (GNB). In a smaller percentage of cases, it appears that viruses are</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">involved (12%–18%), and the strongest causative associations have been drawn with particularly influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HPV); these three organisms may account for 8% to 14% of pneumonias in older adults—particularly during seasonal outbreaks.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Pneumonias are often classified by the etiologic agent (pneumococcal pneumonia, staphylococcal pneumonia, etc), but this approach is not very practical from a clinical point of view, as the causative pathogen is generally unknown at the time of diagnosis and is often never established. Therefore, initial treatment must be established empirically and may not be modifiable based on a microbiologic diagnosis. In clinical practice, it is more useful to consider other aspects to select initial therapy such as the immunocompetence of the host, the place of acquisition, the presence of risk factors for resistant microorganisms, and the severity of the acute episode.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Differentiation depending on the immunocompetence of the host is essential, as this frequently points to a totally different etiologic spectrum. The type of immunosuppression, intensity, and duration influence the etiology, management, and prognosis. Neutropenia favors pneumonia due to <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(SA), enteric GNB such as <i>Pseudomonas</i></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aeruginosa <span class="p">(Ps), and fungi (especially </span>Aspergillus <span class="p">spp, </span>Mucor<span class="p">, or </span>Candida<span class="p">). Cellular immunodeficiency, as in an advanced HIV infection, transplant patients, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, predisposes to bacterial pneumonia with a much larger spectrum than in immunocompetent patients, including Ps, SA, </span>L pneumophila<span class="p">, tuberculosis, invasive fungal infections, </span>Pneumocystis jiroveci<span class="p">, viral pneumonia due to </span>cytomegalovirus <span class="p">or RSV, helminths, or protozoa.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Depending on the place of acquisition, pneumonia is classified as either CAP or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). CAP is pneumonia that presents outside the hospital setting (and may be further differentiated into health care–associated pneumonia [HCAP]—see commentary below). HAP occurs after more than 48 hours of hospital stay or during 10 to 14 days after a hospital discharge. This differentiation is important due to the spectrum in microbial etiology. The microorganisms most frequently isolated in HAP are enteric GNB (<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli</i>, Ps, <i>Serratia marcescens</i>, and <i>Enterobacter </i>spp), followed by gram-positive cocci (SA). In severe HAP, Ps and <i>Acinetobacter </i>spp are the most common among gram- negative bacteria. Viruses and fungi are isolated less frequently, but must be</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">taken into account in immunocompromised patients. The etiology may vary depending on the period of time pneumonia develops. In early HAP (within 5 days), the most common etiology is enteric GNB (<i>E coli, K pneumoniae, Proteus</i>, and <i>Serratia</i>), <i>H influenzae</i>, SA, and <i>S pneumoniae</i>. In late HAP (more than 5 days), A<i>cinetobacter </i>spp, Ps, and methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) increase in frequency. There are additional, specific risk factors associated with certain microorganisms that can guide the clinician toward a specific diagnosis in HAP. These risk factors can be useful when deciding the antibiotic treatment to establish (<span class="s1">Table 105-1</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 105-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS FOR HOSPITAL- ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Health care–associated pneumonia (HCAP) can be defined as pneumonia that occurs in patients who meet one of the following criteria: (1) hospitalization for 2 days or more in the preceding 90 days; (2) residence in a nursing home or extended care facility; (3) home infusion therapy (including antibiotics); (4) chronic dialysis within 30 days; (5) home wound care; or (6) family member with multidrug-resistant pathogen. However, this concept is currently under some scrutiny. Evidence provided by two large retrospective observational studies that included patients from the United States showed that those who met one of these criteria had a higher prevalence of pneumonia caused by MRSA or resistant GNB, such as Ps.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These results have not been confirmed in studies carried out in European countries. Further, it has been documented that up to 50% of patients with pneumonia attending the emergency department may met criteria for HCAP and only 10% to 30% of these patients have infections caused by resistant bacteria. Therefore, the use of such criteria with high sensitivity and limited</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">specificity may lead to excessive utilization of broad spectrum antimicrobials, unnecessary costs and an increased prevalence of resistant bacteria. Finally, the concept of HCAP does not take into account the severity of the disease, and it is well known that resistant bacteria appear most frequently in patients with severe disease. In conclusion, though widely employed and specifically identified in many guidelines, the HCAP concept lacks the necessary precision to identify a profile of patients at risk of infection by resistant organisms, and therefore an etiologic approach is recommended by many authors based on individual risk factors for infection caused by resistant organisms and severity of disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The etiology of CAP is influenced by comorbidities, basal functional status, severity of the acute episode, antimicrobial treatment received and contact with the hospital setting or place of residence. Therefore, an etiologic approach can also be recommended according to risk factors for resistant microorganisms and severity of disease. Several scales have been developed to rule out infection by multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO). Shorr et al. proposed a scale that includes four items: recent hospitalization (4 points), admission from long-term care (3 points), hemodialysis (2 points), and critical illness (1 point). When the total score is zero, there is a high negative predictive value (84%) for MDRO. Aliberti et al. documented that independent MDRO risk factors were living in a nursing home and previous hospitalization in the last 90 days. Another study found that patients with clinical signs of severe pneumonia and presence of two risk factors (immunosuppression, hospitalization in the previous 90 days, severe dependence quantified with a Barthel index less than 50, and taking antibiotics within the previous 6 months) were associated with a higher frequency of MDRO (2% vs 27%).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It has been published that the probability of Ps or MRSA infection is increased in severe CAP, defined as a pneumonia that requires admission to an ICU or has a risk class V according to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). If we consider the approach proposed by Ewig in Europe and by Brito and Niederman in the United States, when making an empirical treatment decision, the key would be the initial clinical severity status and the prior functional status. Thus, when there are at least two factors for multidrug resistance (severe pneumonia, hospitalization in the previous 90 days, residence in a nursing home, severe basal dependence for daily living</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">activities, immunosuppression, or taking antibiotics during the previous 6 months), empiric coverage of MDRO is warranted.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk Factors for Uncommon Microorganisms</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Colonization of the oropharynx may favor pneumonia due to unusual microorganisms through microaspiration. This is more common in older adults compared to younger patients. Risk factors for less common pathogens are shown in <span class="s1">Table 105-2</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 105-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>RISK FACTORS FOR INFECTION BY LESS COMMON PATHOGENS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Bacterial colonization depends on multiple factors such as age, comorbidity, basal functional status, bacterial load, antimicrobial use, presence of devices, indwelling devices, and prior contact with health centers or nursing homes. Etiologic studies show an increased incidence of pneumonia due to <i>Enterobacteriaceae </i>in relation to age. El-Solh et al. identified <i>Enterobacteriaceae </i>and anaerobes as the most frequently isolated pathogens in institutionalized patients with aspiration pneumonia with the basal functional status as main determining factor. This study concluded that functional impairment is associated with more frequent colonization by GNB, especially <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. Another important aspect to consider in suspected infection by <i>Enterobacteriaceae </i>is whether they may produce extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL). A recent study with the aim to determine the sensitivity of strains isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia, in both the United States and Europe, showed that 20% and 35% of isolated <i>Klebsiella </i>spp (the main <i>Enterobacteriaceae </i>involved in pneumonia) were ESBL-producing in each geographical area.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Despite recognized classical risk factors for anaerobic infection, the role of anaerobes in pneumonia in seniors is not well known because anaerobic cultures or other detection methods are rarely used in studies.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The frequency of Ps in older adults is low (1%–2%). Chronic respiratory disease and nasogastric tube use stand out as the main risk factors. This microorganism should be suspected in severe COPD (FEV<span class="s11">1</span> &lt; 35%</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">predicted), multiple previous antibiotic treatments, admission to ICU and/or presence of bronchiectasis, and prior colonization with this organism.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Finally, it is known that colonization by SA is more frequent when there has been a prior episode of influenza. The probability of MRSA is more frequent in patients admitted in the ICU, with a history of intravenous antibiotic treatment at home or undergoing ulcer care. Shorr et al. proposed a scale to predict MRSA infections with low risk if the score is less than or equal to 1 (2 points: recent hospitalization or ICU admission; 1 point for each of the following: &lt; 30 or &gt; 79 years of age, prior exposure to intravenous antibiotics, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, being a female with diabetes, coming from a residential care home). MRSA infection should be suspected with the presence of pneumonia with bilateral radiological infiltrates with cavitation or in the presence of risk factors, and primarily in patients with severe disease. If the older patient has been living in a nursing home during the previous year, it is important to know the prevalence of MRSA in that institution.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Viral etiologies are increasingly recognized with wider utilization of PCR-based respiratory virus panels. In particular, influenza and RSV cause substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. In the context of outbreaks in institutionalized patients, pneumonia can be caused either by primary viral agents or by a bacterial superinfection from <i>S pneumoniae</i>, SA, and <i>H</i></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">influenzae<span class="p">. Other respiratory viruses, such as parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus (except for SARS-CoV-2), usually cause less severe respiratory infections in immunocompetent

Symptoms and signs of infection in older adults differ from younger patients. Asymptomatic or atypical clinical presentations such as exacerbation of chronic diseases are more frequent presenting manifestations in older adults. Absence of fever, hypoxemia, or respiratory symptoms do not rule out a pneumonia diagnosis. The most common atypical manifestations are altered mental status or behavior, acute functional impairment, falls, dizziness, loss of consciousness, generalized weakness, anorexia, dehydration, or incontinence. Such presenting symptoms are most frequently associated with the presence of cognitive impairment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Initial Evaluation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the time of initial assessment of the older patient with pneumonia stratification by severity of illness should be performed based on the level of consciousness, respiratory, and hemodynamic parameters, taking into account medical, functional, and/or cognitive situations. Nonspecific complaints or atypical clinical presentation are associated with a lower level of acuity and therefore a delay in the initial assessment and early antibiotic administration</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the emergency department. Older adults less frequently have fever, tachycardia, and/or elevation of leukocytes compared with younger patients. These changes may hinder an appropriate diagnosis of sepsis and impact adequate early therapeutic treatment. A recent study has shown that the undisturbed vital signs such as normal heart rate and temperature in older patients with suspected infection delay antibiotic administration and increase the likelihood of hospitalization with the need for intensive care. Therefore, respiratory rate and altered level of consciousness may be the only initial signs of severity in older patients with suspected infection and should trigger evaluation for pneumonia.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic Evaluation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the initial stratification of severity status, tests should be performed to diagnose pneumonia and its etiology. The diagnosis of pneumonia based on physical examination has poor sensitivity and specificity; therefore, the diagnosis should be confirmed by performing a chest x-ray.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The diagnostic tests performed in older adults should not differ from those in younger patients. In daily clinical practice, the chest x-ray is usually enough to rule in the diagnosis of pneumonia in most older patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, radiologic signs may not be obvious in up to 30% of the cases and this is more frequent in patients with dehydration and neutropenia. Therefore, in patients with suspected pneumonia and first chest x-ray without pathologic signs, a second study is recommended after 24 to 48 hours. Computed tomography (CT) is very accurate for the diagnosis of pneumonia, although it is usually reserved either for patients with atypical chest x-ray patterns or as a second step in those cases without response to initial treatment. The role of other imaging tests is evolving. Bedside ultrasound can support suspicion of pneumonia and allows evaluation of suspected pleural effusion as well as guidance for a possible thoracentesis. Other procedures, such as bronchoscopy, CT-guided biopsy, biopsy by thoracotomy, or videothoracoscopy, do not differ from indications in younger adults, except for the logical consideration of the patient’s life expectancy, desires, and the risks and contraindications related to comorbidities.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Regarding laboratory tests, C-reactive protein and white blood cell counts are not helpful for assessing the severity of illness in older patients with pneumonia. The inflammatory response may be impaired as a consequence of immune senescence and thus may underestimate the severity</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the process. Procalcitonin (PCT) has not shown good sensitivity in older populations for the diagnosis of acute bacterial infection, although it may be useful for severity assessment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Serum lactate value greater than or equal to 2 mmol/L is a predictor of 30-day mortality in older adults. MR-proADM is a peptide produced by the endothelium, derived from proadrenomedullin, which is released in a state of physiologic stress. It has been evaluated in observational studies and seems to perform well as a prognostic marker in respiratory infection.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A microbiologic diagnosis should be sought in older adults with pneumonia via blood cultures, Gram stain and culture of respiratory samples, and the detection of bacterial antigens in urine (pneumococcal and</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Legionella <span class="p">immunochromatographic test). European guidelines recommend the performance of blood cultures in all hospitalized patients. US guidelines reserve blood cultures for the most severe patients, such as those with cavitary infiltrates, leukopenia, alcoholism, severe liver disease, asplenia, positive antigenuria test for pneumococcus, or pleural effusion. Blood cultures have low clinical impact when performed in unselected patients with CAP. However, given the high frequency of atypical clinical presentation in older patients, blood cultures may contribute both to the confirmation of diagnostic suspicions, when potential pulmonary pathogens are isolated, and to the reconsideration of the patient’s primary causative agent and therefore it is the opinion of this author that blood cultures should be obtained in all older adults with pneumonia. Adequate sputum cultures can be obtained in about a third of patients, even higher when performed by invasive methods. The importance of Gram stain and sputum culture is reflected in its influence in the modification of the initial antibiotic treatment. The presence of SA, </span>Klebsiella pneumoniae<span class="p">, or Ps in Gram stain of the purulent sputum requires consideration when choosing the antibiotic treatment. Likewise, absence of organisms with the morphology of these agents in high-quality respiratory samples has a high negative predictive value, allowing the narrowing of antimicrobial therapy. In older patients with significant functional impairment, it is often difficult to obtain quality sputum specimens, and an increase in frequency of oropharyngeal colonization by GNB, SA, and MDRO suggests there may be lower specificity of Gram stain and culture of respiratory specimens from such patients.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Detecting pneumococcal and <i>L pneumophila </i>bacterial antigens in urine by immunochromatographic techniques has been an important advance in the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">identification of these two microorganisms. The sensitivity of pneumococcal antigen is estimated at over 60%, with a specificity greater than 90% in adult patients, including patients with chronic bronchitis and pneumococcal colonization. It also has diagnostic value in the pleural fluid and test performance is not altered by prior antibiotic treatment or pneumococcal vaccination. However, the test remains positive until 3 months after the resolution of pneumonia, which limits the utility in patients with recurrences or in the assessment of treatment response. The urinary antigen test for legionellosis only detects <i>L pneumophila </i>serogroup I, with a sensitivity greater than 90%. This is recommended in all patients with suspected clinical or epidemiologic concern for legionellosis or in the case of severe pneumonia without another clear etiology.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Test for viral detection in nasopharyngeal aspirates should be used in epidemiologic studies and in those patients diagnosed with influenza who are candidates for antiviral treatment. The best use of these tests has not been defined as many viruses that can cause illness are not represented on widely used viral panels (decreasing sensitivity) and a positive test may not provide sufficient evidence of an alternate diagnosis to allow the clinician to stop antibacterial therapy (limited specificity).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk Stratification</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The assessment of severity status is essential to designing an individualized care plan for older patients with pneumonia; age, comorbidity, microbial etiology, and early administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy all influence mortality. Previous studies have showed that older pneumonia patients with moderate-severe basal functional dependence have an increased risk of mortality in the short- and long-term compared to those who are independent.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Several short-term prognostic scales have been published that are helpful for assessing severity status and therefore the decision making for hospital admission. The PSI (<span class="s1">Figure 105-2</span>) and CURB-65 (<span class="s1">Table 105-4</span>) are risk stratification scales with similar predictive power for 30-day mortality, although they have certain limitations. The PSI gives excessive weight to age and relative to hypoxemia and it does not take into account other factors associated with adverse outcomes such as COPD, functional status, social factors, proper oral intake of the patient, or the capacity for good adherence. CURB-65 has the limitation of not including the evaluation of hypoxemia and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">functional status. In fact, studies have suggested oxygenation as the best prognostic indicator in older adults. Neither of these two scales is very useful in assessing the need for ICU admission.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 105-4 <span class="s3">■ </span>PROGNOSTIC SCALES: CURB-65</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s4">FIGURE 105-2. </span>Pneumonia severity should be assessed according to the clinical situation, biomarkers, and risk stratification scales. In severe cases, the possibility of infection by resistant microorganisms is increased; therefore, expanded antimicrobial therapy should be considered, especially when a risk factor is present. Infection by resistant pathogens should be considered, and likelihood of infection by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, or extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing <i>Enterobacteriaceae </i>specifically assessed to choose antibiotic coverage.

As discussed previously, sepsis may be underdiagnosed in older adults due to physiologic changes with aging.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Site of Care</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical guidelines recommend the use of prognostic scales, mainly PSI and CURB-65, for admission decision making. Patients with PSI greater than or equal to III or CURB-65 greater than or equal to 2 meet criteria for hospital admission. The SCAP, SMART-COP, or ATS/IDSA scales can be helpful when deciding on ICU admission. In addition, other issues should be considered regarding site of care such as functional, cognitive, and social factors that may affect the final location.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alternatives to Conventional Hospitalization</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are different units that can treat patients with CAP. A short stay unit (SSU) is a safe and cost-effective alternative to conventional hospitalization for patients with CURB-65 of 2 or PSI of III. In those seniors living in a nursing home, site of care depends on the characteristics of the center, but if appropriate care can be rendered without moving the patient, it is preferable. Several studies have shown the same mortality, adjusted by functional status, among patients treated in the hospital or in nursing home. Transfer to hospital should be under the following circumstances: worsening of underlying disease, immunosuppression, clinical signs of severe pneumonia, oral intolerance, difficulties in completing the treatment in the facility, complications evident on radiography, or individual assessment (eg, need for specific isolation or high risk of morbidity and mortality without advanced directive).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Considerations for Discharge</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical stabilization is considered present when vital signs have normalized, mental status is baseline, and oxygen requirements have improved. The criteria that should be met to discharge the patient include heart rate less than 100 bpm, respiratory rate less than 24 breaths per minute, axillary temperature less than 37.2°C (&lt; 98.96°F), systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, oxygen saturation greater than 90%, good awareness, and tolerance of oral therapy. Most patients with pneumonia usually stabilize between the third and fourth hospital day. However, this period of time may increase up to 7 days in the frail older adults.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Specific Recommendations for Antibiotic Selection in Older Adults</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table 105-8 <span class="p">outlines empirical treatment recommendations according to site of care, functional status, and severity. </span>Table 105-9 <span class="p">reflects the treatment of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">choice depending on the suspected etiology.

First, does the patient have a severe pneumonia or risk factors for unusual microorganisms? And second, does the patient meet the definition of frailty? If the answer to both questions is “no,” therapeutic regimens commonly used in younger adults apply; if the patient has severe pneumonia and/or risk factors for less common pathogens, resistant microorganisms are more likely, and broadening antimicrobial treatment should be considered.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The issue of frailty is more complex. Mildly frail seniors (ie, independent or nearly independent for all basic ADLs) at baseline may suffer acute functional and/or cognitive impairment with pneumonia. In this case, monitoring of clinical, functional, and cognitive areas and interventions to restore function to the previous baseline should be paramount and part of the overall treatment plan. The same antibiotic choices as those used for independent patients suffice.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In moderate-severe frailty, the invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures depend on individual goals and the site of care. Furthermore, these patients usually have severe comorbidity and polypharmacy, making them more vulnerable to the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. In addition, there may be important risk factors that determine specific etiologic risk (MDRO or MRSA colonization, aspiration risk, etc). Antibiotic choices in such patients must include broader coverage in addition to routine pathogens.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The first antibiotic dose should be administered as soon as possible because a shorter interval to effective therapy is associated with decreased length of hospital stay and mortality, both in nonsevere patients and in those who present with severe sepsis or septic shock. Combination therapy is indicated in patients that meet criteria for ICU admission; β-lactam and a macrolide or fluoroquinolone are superior to fluoroquinolone monotherapy. If influenza is circulating in the community, oseltamivir should be added, even if more than 48 hours have passed since symptom onset, and treatment against <i>S aureus </i>provided until cultures suggest otherwise. In patients with risk factors, empiric MRSA treatment is advisable while awaiting conventional cultures and nasopharyngeal swabs—specific treatment against MRSA should be suspended if these are negative.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Intracellular pathogens are less common in older patients compared to younger patients, and the need for coverage of atypical pathogens is currently a point of discussion. In some studies, the incidence of “atypical pneumonia” can reach 50% and mixed infections may represent 10% to 15% of cases.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is some controversy, except for <i>L pneumophila</i>, regarding the benefit of atypical pathogen coverage; American guidelines recommend adequate coverage of atypical pathogens in all cases, while the British guidelines limit it to patients requiring hospitalization. For <i>L pneumophila</i>, recent studies show similar rates of causality in nonsevere pneumonia and those requiring hospitalization. Therefore, if it is not possible to rule out infection due to <i>Legionella</i>, a macrolide or respiratory quinolone should be given with a β- lactam. In case of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, quinolones should not be prescribed due to their tuberculostatic activity and the possibility of delaying the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Finally, it should be emphasized that aging produces certain pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modifications of drugs. Doses and intervals must be adapted to the older patient’s body weight (or body mass</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">index) and renal function, and modified by drug interactions. Underdosing antibiotics have severe consequences and should be avoided as vigorously as overdosing to ensure the best outcome and reduce the risk of emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Switch From Intravenous to Oral Antibiotics and Duration of Therapy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After reaching clinical stability, a switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic formulations is safe and reduces length of hospital stay with equivalent outcomes. The presence of bacteremia does not extend the required duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Isolation of a causative organism should prompt de-escalation to specific, narrowed coverage, but when no organism is isolated, it is advisable to complete therapy using and oral equivalent with respect to the spectrum of activity.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Meta-analyses suggest 5 to 7 days of antibiotic treatment is sufficient to cure pneumonia even in older adults. However, there are exceptions, and treatment should be extended in cases of infection by <i>Legionella</i>, resistant GNB, or MRSA. In addition, there are clinical situations that may also involve an extension of the duration, such as persistent fever over 72 hours, persistence of more than one criterion of clinical instability, inadequate initial coverage, or the occurrence of complications.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment Failure</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment failure is defined as the absence of clinical stability after 3 to 4 days of antibiotic treatment or the occurrence of clinical deterioration, respiratory failure, or septic shock in the first 72 hours. This situation is associated with a fivefold increase in mortality. However, reaching clinical stability may take longer without implying a therapeutic failure in older patients with severe pneumonia or concomitant serious comorbidity such as severe COPD or untreated heart failure.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Possible causes of treatment failure include resistant microorganisms, involvement of unusual pathogens, lack of optimized treatment for comorbidity, or the existence of an undiagnosed concomitant process (eg, pulmonary embolism, neoplasm).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">When treatment failure is suspected antibiotics should be changed if culture data suggest a pathogen resistant to antibiotics being given, comorbidity treatment optimized, and new imaging studies may be of value. Broadening the antimicrobial spectrum should follow, and risk factors for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unusual pathogens reevaluated or the possibility of infection by fungi, mycobacteria, <i>Nocardia</i>, and other unusual pathogens reconsidered.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concomitant Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In conjunction with antibiotic treatment, other therapeutic measures should be carried out such as proper oxygenation (including initial appraisal of noninvasive mechanical ventilation, especially in patients with respiratory failure), fluid balance, and the correction of electrolyte disturbances, glycemic control, management of associated comorbidities, nutritional support if needed, and the prevention of thromboembolic events. Early physical and cognitive stimulation is very important, even for inpatients; early mobilization is recommended, if possible from the first day of admission, seating the patient out of bed for a minimum of 20 minutes and subsequent progressive mobilization recommended.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Palliative Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pneumonia is a common complication in older patients with advanced dementia and limited life prognosis, often being the final cause of death. The identification of these patients is very important in order to provide adequate palliative treatment, since in this patient profile clear benefits of intravenous antibiotic therapy have not been proven. Withholding antibiotics may be very appropriate for some patients and palliative treatment only considered individually.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PREVENTION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Given the high incidence, morbidity, and mortality of pneumonia in older adults, preventive measures, especially vaccination, are critical. This becomes even more important in institutionalized older adults, where “herd” immunity plays a major role in reducing risk. Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus is recommended for all patients aged 65 and older.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite the existence of a reduced response to vaccination, particularly in frail seniors, risk of infection, mortality, and associated complications is lower in patients vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcus compared with those unvaccinated. Recently, conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has been recommended in addition to polysaccharide for all adults aged 65 and older. According to the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), PCV13 should be given first with PPS given at least 8 weeks later.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In older adults at risk of aspiration pneumonia, oral care may reduce pneumonia, though efficacy in the highest risk groups (eg, nursing home residents) was not demonstrated in a high-quality, randomized study. Oral hygiene should be performed daily by mechanical cleaning (brushing and sponging of the mucosa and lips twice a day and floss once a day), rinsing with chlorhexidine gluconate in cases of gingivitis, saliva substitutes if there is xerostomia, and weekly oral evaluation. If partial or full dental prostheses are present, they should be brushed and left in a cleaning solution for 10 minutes and rinsed using the same procedure as in patients with teeth.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Postural measures for feeding (elevation of the head of the bed and remaining in that position until 2 hours after completion of the intake) make sense, but have not been proven to reduce risk in rigorous trials.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There is increasing data on pharmacological interventions that act on the swallowing reflex such as those involved in the thermoregulatory centers and the cough reflex. It is important to avoid all medications that could potentiate aspirations, such as sedatives, and especially antipsychotics. The use of proton pump inhibitors that produce achlorhydria and stomach bacteria is an issue of debate, but should be clearly justified if given. Treatment of hypertension and heart failure may include the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and in seniors at risk for pneumonia, the stimulated cough reflex may reduce risk. Other preventive measures that can reduce infections in seniors include optimizing treatment of comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, heart failure) and improving nutritional status.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epidemiology</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mycobacterium tuberculosis <span class="p">causes tuberculosis (TB) and is a leading infectious cause of death in adults worldwide.

TB continues to be an important social and health problem in our environment today, given that the geriatric contingent represents a considerable part of the population, doubly exposed to suffering from the disease, either due to the reactivation of an old</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">form, or due to exogenous disease, and their forms of presentation seem to differ from those usually seen. The disease has two waves of higher incidence, one between 15 and 35 years old and another after 65 years of age. TB can be activated during the course of life, especially as a consequence of the alterations in immune response in old age. Long-term facilities, especially those related to geriatric care, represent an increase in bacillary transmission.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Etiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mycobacteria are slow-growing aerobic bacilli. Their distinctive characteristic is a complex cell envelope rich in lipids, responsible for their classification as acid-alcohol resistant, and their relative resistance to Gram staining. Tuberculosis really only designates the disease caused by <i>M</i></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tuberculosis<span class="p">, the main reservoir of which is humans. A similar disease can occasionally be found due to infection with closely related mycobacteria, such as </span>M bovis, M africanum<span class="p">, and </span>M microti<span class="p">, which, in conjunction with </span>M tuberculosis<span class="p">, are known as the </span>Mycobacterium tuberculosis <span class="p">complex.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathophysiology and Immunological Aspects</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With age there is a decline in immunological protection both in the production of high-affinity antibodies as well as a decrease in immune memory in response to vaccination and delayed hypersensitivity. In senescence, in addition to the response of T cells, which contribute to defense against infections with the production of specific cytokine patterns, other frequent and negative extrinsic factors associated with age and tuberculosis must be taken into account, such as inappropriate diet, poor nutritional status, low physical activity, and comorbidity. In the immune system, by displaying antigens, macrophages, give rise to clonal proliferation of T lymphocytes that differentiate into memory T lymphocytes, cytotoxic and suppressor T helper lymphocytes (CD4+), and T lymphocytes (CD8+). When suppressor CD8+ T lymphocytes show high activity with little response to CD4+, as can occur with age, large numbers of bacilli are released and severe forms of the disease appear.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Asymptomatic parasitic infections have been described that, when associated with TB and other immunosuppressive states, can lead to genetic activation of type 2 cytokines, instead of type 1 cytokine response, which would be adequate against TB, and could explain cases with extensive TB</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">disease. In the same way, a decrease in previously elevated cytokine levels may be indicative of good response to treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older adults are at greater risk of suffering therapeutic failure and adverse drug reactions due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations produced by physiologic changes secondary to aging, associated chronic diseases and drug interactions as a consequence of polypharmacy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">TB can occur in three stages: primary infection, latent infection, and active infection. Initially, the <i>M tuberculosis </i>bacillus causes a primary infection that does not usually lead to acute disease. Most primary infections (about 95%) do not produce symptoms and in the end enter a latent phase. A variable percentage of latent infections are reactivated with signs and symptoms of the disease. The infection is not usually transmitted during the primary stage and is not contagious in the latent phase.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primary infection <span class="p">TB infection requires the inhalation of particles small enough to pass through the upper respiratory defenses and settle in the deep regions of the lungs, usually in the subpleural air spaces of the middle or lower lobes. Larger droplets tend to lodge in the more proximal airways and do not cause infection. To initiate infection, alveolar macrophages must ingest </span><span class="s9">M</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tuberculosis <span class="p">bacilli. Then, bacilli not destroyed by macrophages replicate within and ultimately kill the macrophages that host them (with the cooperation of CD8 lymphocytes); inflammatory cells are attracted to the area, where they cause localized pneumonitis that coalesces to form the characteristic tubercles observed on histological examination. During the first weeks of infection, some infected macrophages migrate to regional lymph nodes (eg, hilar, mediastinal), where they enter the bloodstream. The microorganisms then spread hematogenously to any part of the body, especially the apicoposterior portion of the lungs, the epiphyses of long bones, the kidneys, the vertebral bodies, and the meninges. Hematogenous spread is less likely in patients with partial immunity due to vaccination or previous natural infection with </span>M tuberculosis <span class="p">or environmental mycobacteria.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Latent infection <span class="p">Latent infection occurs after most primary infections. After about 3 weeks of unlimited growth, in about 95% of cases, the immune system inhibits bacillary replication, usually before the appearance of signs or symptoms. Bacilli foci in the lungs or other sites develop into epithelioid cell granulomas, which may have caseous and necrotic centers. Tubercle bacilli can survive in this material for years, and the balance between host</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">resistance and virulence of the organism determines the possibility that the infection will resolve without treatment, remain latent, or become active. Infectious foci can leave fibronodular scars on the apices of one or both lungs (foci of Simon, which generally occur as a result of hematogenous arrival from another site of infection) or small areas of consolidation (foci of Ghon). A Ghon focus with lymph node involvement is a Ghon complex, which, if calcified, is called a Ranke complex. The tuberculin test and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are positive during the latent phase of infection. Latent infection sites are dynamic processes, not entirely inactive as previously believed.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Less commonly, the primary focus progresses immediately and causes acute illness with pneumonia (often cavitary), pleural effusion, and significant enlargement of the mediastinum or hilar lymph nodes (which, in children, can compress the bronchi). Small pleural effusions are primarily lymphocytic, typically contain few organisms, and resolve within a few weeks. This sequence is more frequently seen in young children and in recently infected or reinfected immunocompromised patients.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Extrapulmonary TB can appear anywhere and manifest without evidence of pulmonary involvement. Tuberculous lymphadenopathy is the most common extrapulmonary presentation; however, meningitis is the most feared due to its high mortality rate at the extremes of life.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Active disease <span class="p">Healthy people who are infected with TB have a 5% to 10% risk of developing active disease during their lifetime, although the percentage varies significantly based on age and other risk factors. In 50% to 80% of people with active disease, TB reactivates within the first 2 years, but it can also manifest several decades later. Any organ seeded by the primary infection can host a focus of reactivation, although these foci are most frequently identified in the pulmonary apexes, which may be due to more favorable conditions, such as elevated oxygen tension. Foci of Ghon and involved hilar lymph nodes are less likely to reactivate. Pathologies that impair cellular immunity (which is essential for defense against TB) significantly facilitate reactivation. Therefore, HIV coinfected patients who do not receive appropriate antiretroviral treatment have a 10% annual risk of developing active disease, diabetes, head and neck cancer, gastrectomy, jejunoileal bypass surgery, dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, and significant weight loss, which are conditions that facilitate reactivation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients who require immunosuppression after solid organ transplantation are</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">at increased risk, but other immunosuppressants, such as corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, can also cause reactivation. Smoking is also a risk factor.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In some patients, active disease develops when they are reinfected, rather than when latent disease reactivates. Reinfection is more likely to be the mechanism in areas where TB is prevalent and patients are exposed to a large inoculum of bacilli. Reactivation of latent infection predominates in low prevalence areas. In a given patient, it is difficult to determine whether active disease is the result of reinfection or reactivation.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Characteristics</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the immunocompetent population, the usual form of presentation of TB is pulmonary. However, TB in older patients acquires a series of special characteristics with respect to other age groups. Thus, there is a high risk of disseminated forms, or less radiological evidence of cavitation in its pulmonary presentation. Consequently, this can lead to a high morbidity and mortality in this group, perhaps derived from a delay in diagnosis and the frequent association with other intercurrent diseases in this population group.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">From a clinical point of view, if TB has been defined as the great simulator, this is particularly true in immunosuppressed patients and in those older than 65 years. In patients older than 65 years with pulmonary disease, the forms of radiological presentation are different from those described in individuals younger than 65 years, but the most prominent is the presentation of extrapulmonary disease, as well as infrequent, cryptic, or disseminated forms. All of this, together with the high comorbidity of this population, can lead to diagnostic delays with high morbidity and mortality, and it is not uncommon for the final diagnosis to be given in the autopsy report.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">TB damages tissues through a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (DHT), which causes typical granulomatous necrosis with the histological appearance of caseous necrosis. Pulmonary lesions are usually cavitary, especially in immunocompromised patients with compromised delayed hypersensitivity. Pleural effusion is found less frequently than in primary progressive TB, but it can appear as a result of direct spread of infection or hematogenous spread. The rupture of a large tuberculous lesion in the pleural space can cause an empyema with or without a bronchopleural fistula, and sometimes pneumothorax. In the prechemotherapy era, tuberculous empyema could complicate the treatment of a drug-induced pneumothorax and lead to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rapid death, and so could massive sudden hemoptysis secondary to erosion of the pulmonary artery by a proliferating cavity. The course of TB varies greatly depending on the virulence of the microorganism and the defenses of the host. Evolution can be rapid in members of isolated populations who, unlike many Europeans and their American descendants, have not experienced centuries of selective pressure to develop innate or natural immunity to disease. In European and American populations, evolution is more silent and slower.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes an acute respiratory distress syndrome appears due to the development of hypersensitivity to antigens of the tubercle bacillus and occurs after rapid hematogenous spread or rupture of a large cavity with intrapulmonary bleeding.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Reactivation of the disease in older adults can involve all organs, although those most frequently affected are the lungs, brain, kidneys, long bones, vertebrae, or lymph nodes. Reactivation may cause few symptoms and go unnoticed for weeks to months, delaying proper evaluation. The frequent finding of other diseases in older adults further complicates the diagnosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Regardless of their age, nursing home residents are at risk of contracting the disease due to recent transmission, which can cause apical, middle lobe, or lower lobe pneumonia, as well as pleural effusion. Pneumonia may not be recognized as TB and may persist and also spread to others, while being erroneously treated with ineffective broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the United States, miliary TB and tuberculous meningitis, which in the past were believed to mainly affect young children, are more common in older adults.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TB is a frequently overlooked diagnosis in older patients. A high index of suspicion is crucial for the identification of infected individuals.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tuberculin skin test <span class="p">The Mantoux method of the tuberculin skin test (TST) remains the diagnosis modality of choice despite its potential for fast negative results. In older patients, there is an increase in anergy to cutaneous antigens. Therefore, the two-step tuberculin test is suggested for initial geriatric assessment in order to avoid potential false negative reactions. This means that after a negative response to the TST (induration of &lt; 10 mm) other tests must be performed after 2 weeks. A positive TST reaction is a skin test of 10 mm or more and an increase of 6 mm or more over the first skin test reaction.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Conversion must not be confused with the previously described booster phenomenon. Conversion occurs in persons previously uninfected but with a true negative TST who become infected within 2 years as demonstrated by a positive TST. Decreased skin test reactivity is associated with waning delayed-type hypersensitivity over time, disseminated TB, corticosteroids, and other drugs, and the elimination of TB infections. A false positive TST occurs with cross-reactions with nontuberculous mycobacteria and in persons receiving the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chest radiography <span class="p">Chest x-ray is indicated in all individuals with suspected TB infection. Although reactivation of tuberculosis disease characteristically involves the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes of the lungs, many older patients manifest the pulmonary infection in either the middle or lower lobes of the pleura, and also present with interstitial, patchy, or cavitary infiltrates that may be bilateral. Primary TB can involve any lung segment but more often tends to involve the middle or lower lobs, as well as mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Laboratory diagnosis <span class="p">Sputum samples must be collected from all patients with pulmonary symptoms or chest radiography changes compatible with TB disease. Other diagnostic techniques, such as sputum induction or bronchoscopy, should be considered in patients unable to expectorate sputum. Flexible bronchoscopy to obtain bronchial washings and to perform bronchial biopsies has diagnostic value in older adults. However, in frail and very old patients, the risk of such a procedure must be carefully balanced against the potential benefit of making a definite diagnosis of TB.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Sputum samples must initially be examined by smear before and after concentrations and then cultured for <i>M tuberculosis</i>. Smear tests for <i>M</i></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><i>tuberculosis </i>are designed to detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and require a minimum of 10<span class="s22">4-5</span> AFB per mm to be seen by light microscopy. Culture methods may require up to 6 weeks for growth, and therefore, many laboratories use radiometric procedures for the isolation and susceptibility</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">testing of <i>M tuberculosis</i>. Radiometric systems can identify the organisms in as few as 8 days.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Histologic examination of tissue from various sites, such as the liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow, pleura, or synovium, can show the characteristic tissue reaction (caseous necrosis with granuloma formation) with or without AFB, which also strongly supports the diagnosis of TB.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The IGRA test (interferon-γ release assay) was designed to improve latent TB infection diagnosis and increase the sensitivity and specificity by means of quantifying interferon-γ produced by sensitized T lymphocytes in response to contact with specific <i>M tuberculosis </i>antigens. The specificity of IGRA test for mycobacterium complex diagnosis is much higher than that of the tuberculin skin tests, maintaining the same sensitivity, with the exception of the immunosuppressed patients and those under 5 years in which is lower. Gamma interferon is an important molecule for the control of TB infection, and its participation is essential in the protective immune response against this microorganism. This cytokine is produced by CD4+, CD8+, and NK T lymphocytes and activates infected macrophages, with the consequent release of IL-1 and TNF-γ, which limit the growth and multiplication of mycobacteria.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">However, the IGRA test is still incapable of discriminating either previous from current <i>M tuberculosis </i>infection or differentiating between latent and active TB. A positive IGRA test result indicates infection with TB bacteria. However, more tests are needed to determine if a person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A negative IGRA test result indicates little likelihood of having latent TB infection or disease. Clinical efficacy is affected in immunocompromised individuals owing to a reduced and fluctuant interferon-γ synthesis in these patients. Factors such as immunosuppression contribute to obtaining indeterminate results, which must be taken into account when interpreting the test.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The treatment of TB in older adults does not differ from that in the adult population, although it must be taken into account that adverse effects increase with age. The goals of TB treatment include eradication of <i>M</i></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tuberculosis <span class="p">infection, and prevention of transmission, disease relapse, and the development of drug resistance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The risks and benefits of preventive treatment must be carefully evaluated before treating the older adult. Isoniazid causes hepatotoxicity in up to 4% to 5% of patients older than 65 years (compared to &lt; 1% in those &lt; 65 years old).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Risk factors for treatment failure and relapse include inadequate adherence to treatment, high burden of clinical disease (presence of cavitary</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">disease, bilateral disease, and/or extrapulmonary disease), drug resistance, malabsorption, malnourishment, and mistakes in diagnosis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemoprophylaxis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Due to the possible appearance of adverse events in older adult, chemoprophylaxis is generally administered only if the induration of the Mantoux TST increases by ≥ 15 mm following a previous negative reaction. In close contacts of patients with active TB and other individuals at high risk with negative TST or interferon-γ release tests, preventive treatment should also be considered, unless contraindicated.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intensive Phase</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First-line drugs include isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Drug doses are summarized in <span class="s1">Table 105-12</span>. The drugs should be administered on an empty stomach if tolerated, but dosing with food is acceptable to ameliorate gastrointestinal upset and is preferable to dividing doses or changing to second-line agents.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 105-12 <span class="s3">■ </span>TREATMENT OF PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The intensive phase usually consists of four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) administered for 2 months. The use of this regimen is intended to minimize the likelihood of developing secondary resistance to rifampin in regions with a high rate of primary resistance to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">isoniazid (≥ 4%). If susceptibility data become available before the end of the intensive phase and demonstrate that the isolate is sensitive to isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide, ethambutol may be discontinued.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">If pyrazinamide must be excluded from the intensive phase of treatment (due to hepatotoxicity, gout, or pregnancy), the intensive phase should consist of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol administered daily for 2 months, and the continuation phase should be extended to 7 months (total duration of treatment extended to 9 months).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Continuation Phase</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The continuation phase usually consists of two drugs (isoniazid and rifampin) administered for at least 4 additional months for a total of 6 months. The continuation phase should be extended to 7 months (total duration of treatment 9 months) for patients in the following circumstances:</p><ol id="l89"><li data-list-text="a."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Patients with both cavitary pulmonary TB on initial chest radiograph and positive sputum culture after the 2-month intensive-phase treatment. The decision to prolong the continuation phase for patients with either cavitation or positive cultures (but not both) should be made on an individual basis.</p></li><li data-list-text="b."><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Patients in whom the intensive treatment phase did not include 2 months of pyrazinamide.</p></li></ol><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drug-Resistant TB</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drug-resistant TB varies according to the pattern of resistance. In general, multidrug-resistant TB requires treatment for 18 to 24 months with a regimen containing four or five active drugs. The presumed activity is based on the results of susceptibility tests, previous exposure to antituberculosis drugs, or patterns of drug susceptibility in the community. The regimen should include all remaining active first-line drugs, including pyrazinamide if the strain is susceptible, plus second-line drugs. Fluoroquinolones are alternative antituberculous agents that should only be used with other second-line drugs as needed to achieve a four-dose regimen or five drugs in patients with drug intolerance or resistance to first-line agents. Designing a treatment regimen for super-resistant TB is even more challenging, often requiring the use of highly toxic and unproven drugs such as clofazimine and linezolid.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment of Latent TB</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment of latent TB is primarily indicated in people with a negative TST result, which became positive in the previous 2 years, and people with radiological changes compatible with previous TB but without evidence of active TB. Other indications for preventive treatment are people who, if infected, would be at high risk of developing active TB (HIV-infected, drug- induced immunodeficiency) and all children older than 5 years who are in close contact with a person with a positive TB smear, regardless of whether they present TST conversion. Other individuals with an incidental positive TST or IGRA test but without these risk factors are usually treated with the drugs indicated for latent TB. However, clinicians must consider the individual risks of drug toxicity and compare these with the benefits of treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Treatment is usually based on the administration of isoniazid for 9 months, unless resistance is suspected. An alternative for isoniazid-resistant or intolerant patients is rifampin for 4 months. Therapy with isoniazid plus rifapentine for 12 weeks was also shown to be effective.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients under treatment for a latent infection should be advised to stop taking the drug if they develop new symptoms, particularly unexplained tiredness, loss of appetite, or nausea. Monitoring the onset of symptoms and encouraging patients to complete treatment are considered to be part of appropriate standard clinical and public health practice.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adverse Events</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antituberculous drugs are associated with a broad array of adverse effects. Hepatotoxicity is an important adverse effect that warrants careful clinical care. In both curative and preventive treatments, the possible development of isoniazid-induced hepatitis increases with age, with no differences between men and women. Despite this and other adverse effects, the benefits versus harm of the treatment have been clearly demonstrated. More than one antituberculous drug in a treatment regimen may be associated with hepatotoxicity, and in some cases the most significant contributor may be identified and eliminated without loss of the other drugs in the regimen.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among the first-line antituberculous drugs, hepatotoxicity may be caused by isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Patients receiving antituberculous therapy should undergo baseline measurement of liver function tests (serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and transaminases). An asymptomatic increase in aspartate transaminase concentrations occurs in approximately 20% of patients treated with the standard four-drug regimen. In most patients, asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations resolve spontaneously over days to weeks.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In general, hepatitis attributed to antituberculous drugs should prompt discontinuation of all hepatotoxic drugs if serum bilirubin values are ≥ 3 mg/dL or serum transaminases are more than five times the upper limit of normal (or, in individuals with symptoms of hepatitis, serum transaminases more than three times the upper limit of normal). Thereafter, once liver function tests return to baseline (or fall to less than twice normal), potentially hepatotoxic drugs can be restarted one at a time with careful monitoring between resumption of each agent.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Alternative regimens for the treatment of TB disease due to susceptible strains in the setting of drug intolerance include the following:</p><ol id="l90"><li data-list-text="a."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">For patients who cannot tolerate isoniazid, a regimen of rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol may be administered for 6 months. Alternatively, rifampin and ethambutol may be given for 12 months, preferably with pyrazinamide during at least the initial 2 months.</p></li><li data-list-text="b."><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">For patients who cannot tolerate rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol may be given for 12 to 18 months, with pyrazinamide during at least the first 2 months. An agent may be added for the first 2 to 3 months in individuals with extensive disease or to shorten the overall treatment duration to 12 months.</p></li><li data-list-text="c."><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">For patients who cannot tolerate pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and rifampin should be administered for 9 months (supplemented by ethambutol until isoniazid and rifampin susceptibility is demonstrated).</p></li><li data-list-text="d."><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">For patients who require a regimen with no hepatotoxic agents, potential agents include ethambutol, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin, an agent, and other second-line oral drugs. The optimal choice of agents and duration of treatment (at least 18 to 24 months) are uncertain.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Aliberti S, Di Pasquale M, Zanaboni AM, et al.

While the presence of bacteria in the urine in older adults is usually asymptomatic and considered a colonization state, symptomatic infection is associated with morbidity and, rarely, mortality.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Optimal management of UTI in this population is challenging in the face of diagnostic uncertainty, concerns with excess antimicrobial use, and increasing antimicrobial resistance in the community and postacute/long-term care (PALTC) settings. In addition, the heterogeneity of the older adult population means approaches may vary for different groups. The impact and management of urinary infection differs for older adults in the community and in those residing in PALTC settings. There are also unique considerations for the subgroup of older adults with chronic indwelling catheters and those who are in hospice care toward the end of their life. The discussion in this chapter is relevant to individuals without long-term indwelling catheters, unless otherwise stated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DEFINITIONS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">UTI is both one of the most commonly diagnosed infections in older adults and one of the most difficult infections to accurately diagnose. The uncertainty surrounding the definition of UTI, particularly in older adults, poses significant diagnostic challenges for providers caring for this population. Definitions of bacteriuria, pyuria, and ASB are more universally agreed upon. Bacteriuria implies the presence of bacteria in the urine. Pyuria</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is generally defined by the presence of 10 or more white blood cells (WBC/mm<span class="s22">3</span>) per high-power field (hpf) in a urine sample, suggesting inflammation of the genitourinary tract. ASB is broadly defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine, with or without pyuria, in the absence of</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">localizing (genitourinary) signs or symptoms. In asymptomatic women, the accepted definition for ASB is defined as two consecutive voided urine specimens with isolation of the same uropathogen in quantitative counts greater than or equal to 10<span class="s22">5</span> colony forming units/milliliter (cfu/mL). In asymptomatic men, ASB is defined as a single clean-catch voided urine</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">specimen with one uropathogen isolated in quantitative counts greater than or equal to 10<span class="s22">5</span> cfu/mL. A single <i>catheterized </i>urine specimen with one uropathogen isolated in a quantitative count greater than or equal to 10<span class="s22">2</span> cfu/mL defines ASB in both asymptomatic women and men.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><ul id="l91"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in older adults.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Apply specific considerations and guidelines for evaluation of UTI in older adults residing in postacute/long-term care (PALTC) settings.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Recognize the recommendations and limitations of current guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of UTI in both community-dwelling older adults and residents of PALTC settings.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Utilize strategies to limit unnecessary antibiotic use in older adults with suspected UTI.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><ol id="l92"><li data-list-text="1."><h3 style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">ASB and UTI are the most common reasons antibiotics are prescribed for older adults in both the community and health care settings.</h3></li><li data-list-text="2."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Distinguishing ASB and symptomatic UTI is problematic.

It can be further divided into acute simple cystitis (or uncomplicated cystitis), complicated UTI and catheter-associated UTIs. Acute simple cystitis is most commonly encountered UTI syndrome which is diagnosed when pyuria and bacteriuria are accompanied by urinary symptoms confined to the bladder. These symptoms include dysuria, frequency, gross hematuria, suprapubic pain, and new or worsening urinary incontinence or urgency.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Complicated UTI is diagnosed when pyuria and bacteriuria are accompanied by signs and symptoms that indicate that infection has extended beyond the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bladder. Acute pyelonephritis refers to infection involving renal parenchyma; therefore, it is also considered a complicated UTI. The signs and symptoms that usually suggest infection is extending beyond the bladder include fever, chills/rigors, marked fatigue/malaise, nausea/vomiting, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, or pelvic or perineal pain in men (that may suggest accompanying prostatitis). Usually signs and symptoms of systemic illness in complicated UTI will accompany localizing signs and symptoms of UTI. However, complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) may sometimes present without symptoms of cystitis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) refers to patients with an indwelling urethral, suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization with signs or symptoms compatible with UTI (ie, fever, rigors/chills, clear-cut delirium with no other identified cause, suprapubic tenderness, flank pain/costovertebral angle tenderness, pelvic or perineal discomfort/pain); <b>OR </b>signs or symptoms localizing to genitourinary tract (eg, dysuria, urgency, frequency, gross hematuria, suprapubic tenderness, or flank pain/costovertebral angle tenderness) in patients whose catheters have been removed within the previous 48 hours with no other identified source of infection, <b>ALONG</b></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><b>WITH </b>greater than or equal to 10<span class="s22">5</span> cfu/mL of one or more bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen. It is important to note that even though most patients with CAUTI have higher colony counts (≥ 10<span class="s22">5</span> cfu/mL), some patients may have lower colony counts (≥ 10<span class="s22">2</span> cfu/mL). Recurrent UTI is defined as three or more symptomatic UTIs within a 12-month period or two or more symptomatic UTIs in a 6-month period following clinical resolution of each UTI with antimicrobial treatment <span class="s1">(Table 106-1)</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:27.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 106-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>COMMON DEFINITIONS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EPIDEMIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">UTIs are both common and costly in the United States. They account for more than 8 million outpatient and emergency department visits, and are responsible for over 100,000 hospitalizations with cost of $1.6 billion annually. It is one of the most frequently listed diagnoses among hospitalized patients 50 years or older in the United States, and the incidence of hospital admissions for UTIs has increased dramatically since the late 1990s. UTIs are also the most commonly diagnosed infections in the PALTC settings. A 1- day point prevalence survey of antimicrobial use performed between April and October 2017 involving 161 nursing homes found that one in 38 residents was receiving an antibiotic for UTI and a quarter of antibiotic use was for UTI prophylaxis.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ASB in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The prevalence of ASB increases with age and is more prevalent in those residing in PALTC settings. In healthy, older adult women, ASB ranges from approximately 5% to 20% in women aged 65 to 90, but increases to nearly 45% in women older than 90 years. Bacteriuria is uncommon in younger</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">men, but increases significantly with age, especially in men with prostatic hypertrophy. The rate of ASB is approximately 5% in men living in the community, but increases to 20% in men older than 80 years. ASB is highly prevalent in long-term care (LTC) settings, with multiple studies documenting rates for men and women to be approximately 15% to 50%. The rate of ASB in this population is likely to be higher than current estimates, as adults with urinary incontinence and dementia are more likely to have ASB, but also more likely not to be included in research studies given the difficulty of obtaining a urine specimen. Essentially 100% of chronically catheterized older adults develop bacteriuria within 1 month of catheterization.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">ASB often resolves spontaneously, without antibiotic treatment. A large cohort study evaluating the prevalence of ASB in older men and women living in the community reported that almost 30% of individuals with ASB at baseline had negative urine cultures at 6 months, whereas among those adults that were negative for ASB at baseline, 6% developed bacteriuria at 6 months.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">UTI in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The incidence of UTI in postmenopausal women is 0.07 per person-year according to a large population-based study. Irrespective of gender, the incidence of clinically diagnosed UTI increases with age. Accurately estimating the prevalence of UTI, however, is challenging, as the definition of UTI varies significantly across the literature. For example, a prospective population-based study of healthy older adult women in Brazil described the prevalence of UTI to be approximately 17% over a 2-year period; however, “foul-smelling urine” was included as a symptom in their definition of UTI, even though recent guidelines do not consider it as a diagnostic criterion for UTI. In residents of PALTC settings, the rate of UTI appears to remain high with an estimated rate of 0.15 per patient-year for older women and 0.11 per patient-year for older men. One study of nursing home residents with advanced dementia reported that 27% of older adults were diagnosed with UTI over a 2-year period.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The urinary tract (ie, urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys) is presumed to be sterile in a normal host. However, this premise particularly changes in older adults as those with increasing disability tend to become colonized,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">therefore leading to the high rates of ASB. In most adults, a variety of host factors prevent contamination of the urinary tract from pathogenic organisms. The process of urination is the most effective defense mechanism for preventing bacterial invasion of the urinary tract from gastrointestinal microorganisms. Other mechanisms include acidity of urine, peristaltic activity of ureters, a competent vesicoureteral valve, and a variety of other mucosa and immunologic barriers. UTI most often occurs by an ascending route. Organisms colonize the periurethral area and ascend the urethra into the bladder, and sometimes kidneys. Renal infection is determined by virulence characteristics of the infecting organism or the presence of genitourinary abnormalities, such as obstruction or reflux in the host. Rarely, infection may be hematogenous rather than ascending, with urinary infection secondary to bacteremia from a nonurinary source (this is particularly a consideration when <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>is isolated in patients without an indwelling catheter).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risk Factors in Older Adults for UTI</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Older adults may be at higher risk for development of UTI due to a variety of host factors associated with aging, such as a decline in B- and T-cell function. Environmental factors play a large role, as older adults are more likely to have been exposed to the health care system, either through hospitalization or residence in a LTC facility (LTCF), increasing their exposure to virulent nosocomial organisms. Hospitalization often leads to genitourinary instrumentation, and placement of an indwelling catheter has consistently been shown to be a strong risk factor for development of symptomatic UTI in both men and women. Older adults are more likely to have structural or functional abnormalities (eg, benign prostatic hypertrophy in men and cystoceles in women), which lead to urinary stasis by impairing normal voiding and, thus, inhibit the host from “flushing” pathogenic organisms. However, having a high postvoid residual (PVR) has not consistently been shown to increase the risk of developing a symptomatic UTI in either ambulatory women or in PALTC residents. A case-control study in an outpatient setting comparing 149 postmenopausal women who had a history of recurrent UTI with 53 age-matched women without a history of UTI identified three urologic risk factors for recurrent UTI including incontinence (41% vs 9.0%, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001), presence of a cystocele (19% vs</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">0%; <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001), and postvoiding residual urine (28% vs 2.0%; <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, a large prospective cohort study of ambulatory women aged 55 to 75 did not find PVR greater than 200 mL to be significantly associated with developing UTI compared to women with residuals less than 50 mL. Another prospective surveillance study in both male and female residents of six Norwegian nursing homes did not find a significant difference in mean PVR between residents who developed UTI compared to those that did not (79 vs 97 mL, <i>p </i>= 0.26). They also concluded that having a PVR of 100 mL or greater was not associated with an increasing risk of developing UTI.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The most common risk factor associated with developing UTI in older adults is having a history of UTI. A case-controlled study of postmenopausal women found over a fourfold increase in developing UTI in those women with at least one infection before menopause compared to those with no prior history (odds ratio [OR] 4.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.25–5.42). In postmenopausal women, sexual activity, urinary incontinence, and estrogen deficiency have all been associated with developing UTI, although the extent to which they increase the risk is debated, as studies have demonstrated conflicting results. Declining estrogen levels is associated with increased colonization of the vagina with potential uropathogens. Postmenopausal women are less likely to have lactobacilli colonizing the vagina, and more likely to have <i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>Enterococci </i>spp. These changes in vaginal flora, together with the higher pH in the absence of lactobacilli, are similar to changes observed in younger women with recurrent UTI, and have been suggested to facilitate urinary infection in older women. Certain comorbidities have been linked to developing UTI in older adults. Diabetes mellitus appears to have the strongest association across all age groups. In a cohort of postmenopausal women, those with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were almost three times as likely to develop UTI compared to women without diabetes (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.78–4.35). Older adults with diabetes are also at an increased risk for having UTI from a more uncommon uropathogen (eg, <i>Pseudomonas </i>spp, <i>Proteus </i>spp) and more likely to develop upper tract disease (eg, pyelonephritis). In a cohort of outpatient male veterans with UTI, the most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (35%), prostate hypertrophy (33%), and history of prior UTI (31%). Other comorbidities that have been associated with UTI include cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PRESENTATION AND EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asymptomatic Bacteriuria</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It has been well documented that clinicians should not screen older adults for ASB and those with ASB should not be treated with antibiotics. Four prospective randomized studies evaluating treatment of ASB in older adults demonstrated no differences in morbidity or mortality in those treated with antibiotics compared to those who did not receive treatment. Furthermore, persistent asymptomatic colonization of the urinary tract is not associated with an increased risk of development of renal failure or hypertension. Thus, the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), AMDA—the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine’s UTI consensus statement, and the American Geriatrics Society’s Choosing Wisely campaign all recommend against screening and treating for ASB in this population. Only in older adults undergoing invasive urologic procedures should ASB screening and treatment be considered (<span class="s1">Table 106- 2</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 106-2 <span class="s3">■ </span>SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCREENING AND TREATMENT OF ASB IN OLDER ADULTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation and Evaluation of Symptomatic UTI</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The presentation of UTI varies significantly in the older population and is particularly dependent on a person’s age, medical comorbidities (eg, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease, etc), structural or</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">functional urinary tract abnormalities, demographics (ie, PALTC settings or community-dwelling), and presence of a urinary catheter (eg, urethral or suprapubic). The wide variety of presentations and uncertainty in the definition of what constitutes a symptomatic UTI make it one of the most challenging infections to accurately diagnose and effectively treat.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Community-Dwelling Older Adults</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">In older, cognitively intact adults, the presentation of a symptomatic UTI is similar to that of younger adults and generally begins with the presence of new or worsening genitourinary symptoms. Acute simple cystitis is the most common presentation of symptomatic UTI, and usually manifests as dysuria with or without frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or hematuria. Older adults are often suspected for having a UTI when they manifest nonspecific signs and symptoms (eg, confusion, falls, anorexia, functional decline). However, evidence is building that unless more specific localizing signs and symptoms for UTI are present, clinicians should NOT initiate UTI treatment for these symptoms. A prospective cohort study studied older adults who were admitted to the hospital with delirium to determine the association of treating asymptomatic UTI (defined as suspected UTI without concurrent infectious or urinary symptoms) with functional recovery. They defined poor functional recovery as either death, new permanent long-term institutionalization, or decreased ability to perform activities of daily living. Treatment for asymptomatic UTI was associated with poor functional recovery compared to other older inpatients with delirium (RR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14–1.48 overall). It is important to carefully evaluate the etiology for various nonspecific symptoms as they may have noninfectious etiologies.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with upper tract disease (eg, pyelonephritis) typically have additional symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, and flank pain. Presence of warning signs (such as fever, rigors, acute delirium, or unstable vital signs) should also alert clinicians to evaluate a resident for possible infection. Delirium should be carefully distinguished from other behavioral changes. In addition, alternative etiologies for delirium should also be considered before attributing it to UTI, especially in the absence of additional signs and symptoms of UTI.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation and diagnosis <span class="p">In younger women, the diagnosis and treatment of UTI is usually based on urinary symptoms alone, without the need for confirmation with laboratory testing. Use of a urinary dipstick (to evaluate for leukocyte</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">esterase and nitrite), urinalysis, and urine culture is not routinely recommended in patients with reliable histories. In older adults, this is problematic because of the high prevalence of chronic urinary symptoms (eg, incontinence, urgency, nocturia), which may complicate the diagnosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosing and treating UTI with antibiotics without further evaluation for bacteriuria and pyuria in this age group often lead to overtreatment with antimicrobials, especially in those with known chronic urinary symptoms.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">A study evaluated five different management strategies for evaluation and treatment of UTI in adult women aged 18 to 70 including empirical antibiotics, empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics, targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score, performing dipstick and offering antibiotics based on result and prescribing symptomatic treatment until microbiology results became available followed by targeted antibiotics. The investigators found that all management strategies achieve similar symptom control. In another prospective cohort study, which included women up to the age of 89, outpatient adult women presenting with a possible UTI were asked to delay antibiotic treatment for as long as possible. Over half of women who delayed antibiotic treatment did not ultimately require antibiotic therapy, and 71% of them reported clinical improvement or cure without any antibiotic therapy.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No adults in this study developed worsening disease (pyelonephritis or bacteremia) as a consequence of delaying antibiotic treatment. An older meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving nonpregnant, nonimmunocompromised adult women with clinically and microbiologically documented acute uncomplicated cystitis concluded that antibiotics are superior to placebo in achieving symptom resolution but also reported no difference in development of pyelonephritis. More recent meta- analysis evaluated four RCTs comparing the use of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated UTI in nonpregnant women 18 years or older. Antibiotic treatment was found</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to be more effective than NSAIDs in achieving symptom resolution. The odds of developing upper UTI complications with use of NSAIDs were significantly higher according to this study. However, it has been postulated that the reason for higher upper UTI complications compared to what have been seen in placebo-controlled studies may be related to NSAIDs causing interference with the inflammatory element of the host’s defenses.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Based on above-mentioned evidence, it is reasonable to delay empiric antibiotics in women whose diagnosis of UTI is unclear while continuing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">further evaluation. On the other hand, it is recommended to initiate empiric antibiotics in patients with UTI-specific presentation without further delay after obtaining urine specimens for urinalysis and culture. When UTI is suspected in older adults due to nonspecific clinical presentation without evidence of systemic infection, routine urinary testing should not be performed. Instead, providers should encourage hydration, review medications for potential side effects (eg, diuretics, antipsychotics), and consider other etiologies. If nonspecific clinical symptoms persist, a urinary dipstick can then be performed. If urinary dipstick is positive, and further testing with a urinalysis and urine culture reveals bacteriuria plus pyuria, treatment with antimicrobials for symptomatic UTI may be indicated <span class="s1">(Figure 106-1)</span>. In all cases, a clean catch voided urine specimen collected to minimize contamination is preferred. Women should use an antiseptic cloth to first clean the inner folds of the labia, wiping from front to back. A second wipe should then be used to clean the opening of the urethra. Attempts should be made to collect a midstream urine sample, if possible. Although uncommon, symptomatic sexually active women who present with dysuria without pyuria and/or bacteriuria should be evaluated for a sexually transmitted infection (STI). If history is suggestive of a possible STI, screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, HSV, and HIV is warranted.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 106-1. <span class="s5">Urinary tract infection (UTI) assessment and treatment algorithm for older adults.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Postacute and Long-Term Care Residents</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">The presentation of symptomatic UTI in PALTC residents is much more elusive. Residents in these settings often do not present with typical signs or symptoms of a genitourinary tract infection (eg, dysuria, frequency, flank pain) and, similar to community-dwelling older adults, many have chronic urinary symptoms such as urinary incontinence, frequency, nocturia, and urgency making it difficult for providers to distinguish which patients have a symptomatic UTI that would benefit from treatment. Furthermore, residents in PALTC settings often suffer from advance cognitive impairment and are unable to verbally communicate genitourinary symptoms suggestive of a symptomatic UTI. It is recommended that in the absence of specific urinary signs or symptoms, behavioral change (exclusive of delirium), decline in functional status, falls, or anorexia should NOT prompt further evaluation for UTI. Furthermore, change in character of the urine is not</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sufficient to indicate a UTI and may instead reflect mild dehydration or changes to diet or medication.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Evaluation and diagnosis </span>The absence of an agreed-upon definition for symptomatic UTI in PALTC residents makes the diagnosis particularly challenging. Several consensus-based criteria have been published in attempts to help clinicians appropriately prescribe antibiotics for UTI in this population. The McGeer and Loeb criteria, published in 1996 and 2001, respectively, recognized the differences in establishing a diagnosis of infection in LTCFs compared to other settings. The McGeer criteria identified criteria for infection surveillance purposes and the Loeb criteria were developed to help clinicians identify patients that would benefit from empiric antimicrobial therapy. In 2012, an expert consensus panel for SHEA proposed revised guidelines for infection surveillance definitions in LTCFs. The new guidelines (revised McGeer criteria) expanded the definition of UTI and included a new requirement for microbiologic confirmation with urine culture <span class="s1">(Table 106-3)</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 106-3 <span class="s3">■ </span>2012 SHEA SURVEILLANCE DEFINITIONS FOR UTI IN LTC RESIDENTS WITHOUT AN INDWELLING CATHETER</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Both original McGeer and revised McGeer criteria were developed to perform surveillance in nursing homes and therefore are not recommended for clinical decision-making. Loeb minimum criteria were specifically developed for clinical decision-making and require presence of localizing signs and symptoms making these challenging for clinicians to proceed with decision-making when nonspecific signs and symptoms are present. As in community-dwelling older adults, LTC residents with vague, nonspecific symptoms should first be observed for the evolution of symptoms, hydration</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should be optimized, and alternative diagnoses should be considered. Providers should consider holding medications such as antipsychotics and/or diuretics, if possible, to see if symptoms improve. In PALTC settings, these observation, evaluation, and intervention measures can be combined in an order set which is usually referred to as “active monitoring” protocol. An active monitoring protocol usually consists of an order set that specifies frequent monitoring intervals for vital signs, hydration status (eg, fluid intake), and clinical signs and symptoms. This helps nursing home staff to identify any further change in condition. The protocol also includes orders on how to maintain hydration status of the resident (eg, by specifying the amount of fluid the resident should be offered at predefined intervals). Finally, the protocol outlines when a physician should be notified (eg, if signs and symptoms worsen or do not resolve, if new signs and symptoms arise, or if fluid intake is less than a certain predefined amount).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">More recent consensus-based criteria incorporate the use of active monitoring protocol. These consensus-based criteria/guidance include the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) decision tool, Improving Outcomes of UTI (IOU) Consensus Guideline, and International Delphi Consensus decision tool <span class="s1">(Table 106-4)</span>. If upon active monitoring symptoms persist and no other identifiable cause is found, further evaluation is required. A urinary dipstick testing for the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite may be performed in that scenario. In patients with nonspecific symptoms and a negative dipstick for leukocyte esterase and nitrites, clinicians should consider other potential etiologies and suspend further evaluation of UTI. If either leukocyte esterase or nitrites are positive, additional testing in with urinalysis and urine culture may be appropriate (see <span class="s1">Figure 106-1</span>). Every attempt to obtain a clean catch urine is recommended.

care–associated infection. CAUTI is difficult to accurately diagnose in older adults, as older adults with catheters often present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever (33%) and mental status changes (13%). Furthermore, almost all adults with a chronic catheter will have bacteriuria and pyuria making it difficult to distinguish between catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB) and CAUTI in patients with nonspecific symptoms.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Evaluation and diagnosis </span>In 2009, the IDSA updated its current guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CAUTI in adults in an effort to reduce the amount of unnecessary antibiotic treatment in this population. These guidelines include patients with indwelling urethral catheters, indwelling suprapubic catheters, or intermittent catheterization. According to the guidelines, CAUTI is defined as patients with a catheter who develop symptoms or signs compatible with UTI, such as new onset or worsening of fever, rigors, altered mental status, malaise, or lethargy with <i>no </i>other identifiable cause; flank pain; costovertebral angle tenderness; acute hematuria; pelvic discomfort; OR dysuria, urgency, or frequency in patients whose catheters have been removed in the previous 48 hours with no other</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">identified source of infection, along with greater than or equal to 10<span class="s22">3</span> cfu/mL of one or more bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream voided urine specimen from a patient whose catheter has been removed in the previous 48 hours. AMDA UTI consensus statement describes some of the same signs and symptoms but recommends using</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">greater than or equal to 10<span class="s22">5</span> cfu/mL threshold while making clinicians aware that even though most persons with CAUTI will have the higher colony counts, CAUTI can be present with lower colony counts of bacteria (≥ 10<span class="s22">2</span> cfu/mL). The 2012 SHEA surveillance definitions for CAUTI also require the presence of a urinary catheter specimen culture with at least 10<span class="s22">5</span> cfu/mL of any organism(s). Similar to residents without a catheter, CA-ASB should not be screened for, except in patients undergoing urologic instrumentation or procedures. The presence or absence of odorous or cloudy urine should not be used to differentiate CA-ASB from CAUTI <span class="s1">(Table 106-5)</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 106-5 <span class="s3">■ </span>DEFINITIONS FOR UTI IN RESIDENTS WITH AN INDWELLING CATHETER</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MANAGEMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microbiology of UTI</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most frequent organism isolated from urinary cultures in both asymptomatic and symptomatic ambulatory elderly women is <i>E coli</i>, accounting for 75% to 95% of infections. Other organisms occasionally isolated from this population include other <i>Enterobacteriaceae </i>(eg, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) </i>and <i>Enterococcus </i>spp. Rarely, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>or group B and D streptococci will be isolated. Common skin flora in this group usually signify contamination, especially if multiple organisms are present. In uncomplicated UTI, over 95% of infections are due to a single organism. Risk factors for non-<i>E coli </i>UTIs in community-dwelling older adults include male gender, severe clinical presentation (eg, symptoms more than 7 days, documented or reported fever, nausea or vomiting, flank pain), those with a history of UTI in the past 12 months, history of diabetes mellitus, previous failure of trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for treatment of UTI, or patients with functional or anatomical abnormalities. Similar to community-dwelling older</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adults, <i>E coli </i>remains the most frequent organism isolated from urine specimens in residents of LTCFs followed by <i>Proteus </i>spp, <i>Klebsiella </i>spp, <i>Enterococcus </i>spp, <i>Staphylococcus </i>spp and <i>Pseudomonas </i>spp. Less common causes of UTI in this group include <i>Acinetobacter, Candida </i>spp, and methicillin-resistant <i>S aureus </i>(MRSA). In older adults with MRSA detected in urine culture, staphylococcal bacteremia as a potential source should be considered. LTC residents, especially those with a chronic urinary catheter, are also more likely to have polymicrobial bacteriuria, with more than one organism isolated in 10% to 25% of bacteriuric subjects. More recently published data described antibiotic resistance in pathogens causing UTI reported by 243 nursing homes to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) between January 2013 and December 2017. The three most frequently identified pathogens in this dataset are similar to previous reports (<i>E coli</i>, 41%; <i>Proteus </i>species, 14%; and <i>K pneumoniae/oxytoca</i>, 13%).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More than a third (36%) of the UTIs were associated with a resistant pathogen. Among <i>E coli</i>, fluoroquinolone (FQs) and extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistances were most prevalent (50% and 20%, respectively).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment for UTI</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pharmacologic the rapy for ASB in older adults <span class="p">In general, ASB does not require treatment in older adults. However, screening for ASB along with short course of antibiotic treatment (one or two doses) is recommended prior to endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The antibiotic course should be targeted based on the organism identified from the screening urine culture. The therapy should be initiated 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pharmacologic the rapies for community-dwe lling older adults <span class="p">Treatment of UTI for community-dwelling older adults generally follows the same diagnostic algorithm used in younger adults. However, a urine culture should be obtained to guide treatment, as older adults are at higher risk for harboring multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). For acute simple cystitis, the International Clinical Practice Guidelines issued by the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and the IDSA recommend as first-line treatment either nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals, 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, OR TMP/SMX, 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fosfomycin (3 g as a single dose) is an acceptable alternative, although few</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">studies have demonstrated inferior efficacy compared to nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX for treatment of uncomplicated UTI. Fosfomycin continues to have activity against many multidrug-resistant isolates. However, there are concerns that overuse of fosfomycin may result in increasing rates of resistance. Therefore, current recommendations are to use fosfomycin when suspecting infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens or when other first- line agents cannot be used (<span class="s1">Table 106-6</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 106-6 <span class="s3">■ </span>COMMONLY USED ORAL ANTIBIOTICS FOR TREATMENT OF UTI</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It is important to consider prior culture data (if available) or local resistance pattern when choosing antibiotics empirically. In one study, three- quarters of empiric antibiotics provided adequate coverage for the current UTI when clinicians chose the regimen based on susceptibility results from the urine cultures in the preceding 6 to 24 months. In contrast, when the chosen antibiotics were not effective against previously identified pathogens, only one-third of empiric antibiotics provided adequate coverage for UTI. When previous culture results are not available, clinicians should consider</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">looking at local resistance pattern before prescribing the antibiotics. The 2010 guidelines recommend avoiding using TMP/SMX for acute simple cystitis if local resistance rates of uropathogens exceed 20%. Nitrofurantoin is listed on the American Geriatric Society’s Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults due to potential for pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy, especially with long-term use. It recommends avoiding using nitrofurantoin in individuals with creatinine clearance less than 30/mL/min or for long-term suppression.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, nitrofurantoin has consistently lower rates of resistance to <i>E coli </i>(the most commonly identified pathogen in urine cultures), and when given for 5 to 7 days has been shown to have similar effectiveness as other antimicrobials for treatment of acute simple cystitis. Therefore, nitrofurantoin remains a good option for treatment of acute simple cystitis in older adults with creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Second-line antibiotics for empiric treatment of acute simple cystitis or for patients whose organisms are sensitive to the following antibiotics include (1) amoxicillin/clavulanate 500/125 mg orally twice daily for 5 to 7 days; (2) cefpodoxime 100 mg orally twice daily for 5 to 7 days; or (3) cefixime 400 mg orally for 5 to 7 days. FQs are no longer considered first- line treatment of acute simple cystitis because of increasing resistance against gram-negative pathogens and serious side effects associated with its use. These side effects include prolongation of the QT interval, tendon rupture, hypoglycemia, rupture of an aortic aneurysm, peripheral neuropathy, and other central nervous system side effects.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In general, evidence supports that for older adults with acute simple cystitis a shorter course of antibiotics (&lt; 7 days) has similar efficacy as compared to a longer course (≥ 7 days). Further, longer antibiotic course may be associated with more side effects. One of the double blinded RCT compared 3-day course of ciprofloxacin to 7-day course in older women with uncomplicated UTI. They found similar cure rates (98% vs 83%, <i>p </i>= 0.16) 2 days after the course, along with similar reinfection (14% vs 18%, <i>p</i></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">= 0.54) and relapse (15% vs 13%, <i>p </i>= 0.83) rates at 6 weeks posttreatment in both groups. However, adverse events were significantly less in the 3-day versus 7-day group both at day 5 (0.9 vs 1.6, <i>p </i>= 0.001) and day 9 (1.2 vs 2.1, <i>p </i>= 0.001) of treatment. There are several underlying factors that may increase the risk of complications in patients who are being treated for acute simple cystitis <span class="s1">(Table 106-7)</span>. These factors include obstructions,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">instrumentation, impaired voiding, metabolic abnormalities, and immunocompromised status. In past, acute simple cystitis in patients who may have some of these underlying conditions have been treated for longer (10- to 14-day) duration. However, it has been shown that shorter duration of treatment may also be sufficient in patients who are at high risk of recurrence or complications. A retrospective study evaluated the relationship between antibiotic regimen and the cure rate of febrile UTI among patients with neurogenic bladder. The patients were divided into less than 10 days, 10 to 15 days and greater than 15 days groups. One month after the end of treatment, there were no significant differences in the cure rates (71%, 54%, and 57%, <i>p </i>= 0.34). Treatment decision for acute simple cystitis in patients who are at higher risk for recurrence or complications should be based on response to the treatment. For most of these patients, 7 days of antibiotic treatment should be adequate if they respond promptly to antibiotic (within 72 hours). Longer (10- to 14-day) durations are reasonable for those patients who have delayed response to treatment or were found to have more complicated infections (eg, bacteremia).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 106-7 <span class="s3">■ </span>FACTORS THAT MAY PREDISPOSE OLDER ADULTS WITH A UTI TO TREATMENT FAILURE OR COMPLICATIONS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In men, all UTI episodes have been considered as complicated in the past. However, it is not the best way to classify UTI episodes since men can also have acute simple cystitis. The first-line antimicrobial agents for treatment of acute simple cystitis in men are the same as for women (TMP/SMX, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin). However, older men with urologic abnormalities or other immunocompromising conditions are more likely to be at higher risk for complicated infection. Therefore, careful evaluation is always needed to rule out any signs and symptoms indicating extension of infection beyond the bladder before treating acute simple cystitis. In general, men with UTI are usually treated with a 7- to 14-day antibiotic course. A study conducted in male veterans found shorter-course treatments for UTI (&lt; 7 days) to be as effective compared to longer duration of treatment (&gt; 7 days). Another study compared 7- and 14-day courses for patients with febrile UTI. In men, 7 days of antibiotics was inferior to 14 days in achieving short-term (10–18 days posttreatment) clinical cure.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, the long-term clinical cure rates were similar indicating no difference in outcomes at 70 to 84 days posttreatment. Therefore, for most</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">older men with acute simple cystitis 7 days of antibiotic treatment should be adequate if they respond promptly to antibiotics (within 72 hours).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Management of complicated UTI (infection extending beyond the bladder including pyelonephritis) varies depend on the severity of the illness.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although age more than 60 years has been described to be a relative indication for hospitalization in patients with acute pyelonephritis, outpatient management in those with mild to moderate illness, adequate social support, and clinical stability is likely to be as safe and as effective compared to hospitalization. Older adults with complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis) who present with severe symptoms (eg, persistent vomiting), suspected sepsis, uncertain diagnosis, evidence of urinary tract obstruction, and have significant frailty should be hospitalized. FQs are the only oral antibiotic recommended for empiric treatment of complicated UTI. However, increasing resistance of FQ and concerns of side effects limit the use of this drug in many clinical settings. Experts do not recommend empiric FQ use in areas with local resistance noted to be higher than 10%. Similarly, FQ use should also be avoided if patient at high risk for infection with MDROs or adverse events are secondary to its use. If FQ is being used for treatment of complicated UTI in areas with more than 10% resistance, then the patient should receive an initial dose of long-acting parenteral agent (eg, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, etc) before starting FQ. Similarly, if using any other oral antibiotic (eg, TMP-SMX) for empiric treatment of complicated UTI, patients should receive one dose of long-acting parenteral agent before starting the oral antibiotic. Clinicians may consider continuing parenteral treatment and wait for the culture and susceptibility results before switching to oral antibiotics especially if the patient is at higher risk of infection secondary to MDROs or severe illness. Oral beta-lactam agents are usually less effective than FQ and TMP-SMX for treatment of complicated UTI including acute pyelonephritis and should be avoided when other treatment options are available. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin should not be used for complicated UTI because of inadequate renal penetration. When choosing parenteral agent for the initial dose, aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin or tobramycin) are usually avoided because they are more toxic than other available parenteral antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, etc), although the risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity with aminoglycoside therapy is very low when therapy duration is limited to 48 to 72 hours (see <span class="s1">Table 106-6</span>).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pharmacologic the rapies for postacute and LTC residents <span class="p">In general, pharmacologic therapies for postacute and LTC residents are usually similar to what have been described above for community-dwelling older adults. Some of the factors that usually influence decision-making for treatment of UTI may need additional attention in postacute and LTC settings. First, antibiotic resistance is generally much higher in these settings compared to the community population. Thus, it is imperative that clinicians become familiar with local resistance rates and guide empiric antibiotic regimens based on resistance patterns. Urine culture results should always help adjust antibiotic choices. Second, alterations in antimicrobial pharmacokinetics such as increased volume of distribution and decreased renal clearance are often observed in older adults; thus, providers should be cognizant of a patient’s glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when dosing antimicrobials. Third, older adults in these settings often must manage polypharmacy and drug–drug interactions should always be evaluated. For instance, TMP/SMX, along with many other antibiotics, has significant interactions with anticoagulants and thus, close international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring is recommended in patients receiving warfarin. In most cases, warfarin dosages will need to be decreased by at least 50% through the entire duration of antimicrobial therapy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Finally, establishing a diagnosis of UTI is very challenging in frail and medically complex residents of postacute and long-term settings, some of whom may not be able to verbalize any symptoms. In order to avoid initiating unnecessary antibiotic treatment, AMDA’s consensus statement recommends that clinicians in PALTC setting use standard clinical algorithms to guide the diagnosis and decision to initiate antibiotics for residents with suspected UTI.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Several consensus-based criteria have been published to assist with diagnosis and treatment of suspected UTI in residents of PALTC settings (see <span class="s1">Table 106-4</span>). Loeb minimum criteria describe the clinical signs and symptoms that should be present prior to initiating antibiotics in nursing home residents suspected of having infection. AHRQ also developed a set of criteria, which were incorporated into a standard communication and decision aid tool. The UTI SBAR tool developed by AHRQ aims to assist in better assessment of resident signs and symptoms by the nursing home staff, effective communication of those findings with prescribing clinicians, and differentiating between when a resident needs to be started on antibiotic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">versus on an active monitoring protocol. International Delphi Consensus decision tool consists of separate clinical algorithms for management of suspected UTI in frail older adults with and without indwelling catheters. The decision tool describes which specific and nonspecific signs and symptoms are associated with UTI and when the antibiotic prescribing is justified. The IOU consensus statement also used the Delphi procedure to provide guidance on which clinical signs and symptoms to consider when making decision on empiric treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. There has been no head-to-head comparison for the clinical impact of the above- mentioned consensus-based criteria. Therefore, the AMDA UTI consensus statement has suggested that PALTC settings should choose one of the consensus-based criteria that seems most closely aligned with their current practices to facilitate the implementation.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Older adults including residents of postacute and LTC settings may manifest acute illness with atypical signs and symptoms that can also be nonlocalizing. Clinicians should perform careful evaluation to differentiate between infectious and noninfectious etiologies for change of condition in residents of PALTC settings. SHEA has published an expert guidance that outlines those signs and symptoms that should and should not prompt further evaluation for infection in these settings. According to this guidance, clinicians should evaluate residents with fever, hypothermia, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and/or unequivocal delirium for an infection while considering the possibility of noninfectious causes for these symptoms. The guidance recommends against further evaluation for infection in residents who present with a fall, functional decline, or anorexia. Furthermore, it recommends using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) to identify the presence of delirium in a resident of a nursing home with behavioral/mental status changes. Delirium in residents of PALTC settings may be precipitated by a number of infectious and noninfectious conditions, including medications and metabolic disorders. If delirium has been excluded, further evaluation for infection is not necessary unless additional, more specific signs and symptoms are present. The AMDA UTI consensus statement also recommends against initiating empiric treatment for UTI when clinical criteria for UTI are not met and there are no warning signs (ie, evidence of systemic infection, such as fever, rigors/chills, unstable vitals, or new-onset, clear-cut delirium). In those situations, if clinicians are still concerned for UTI, the AMDA consensus statement recommends responding to this</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">diagnostic uncertainty with an “active monitoring” protocol. If the resident condition improves with the supportive care (including hydration), that will obviate the need for treating suspected UTI. The approach to management of suspected UTI in PALTC settings is summarized in <span class="s1">Figure 106-2</span>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 106-2. <span class="s5">Approach to management of suspected UTI in postacute and long-term care settings.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Shorter length of therapy, similar to what is described for community- dwelling older adult, is also sufficient for treatment of UTI in residents of PALTC settings. The recently published AMDA consensus statement recommended fewer than 7-day antibiotic course to PALTC residents with acute simple cystitis who are not severely ill and not at high risk for developing complications. For those residents who are at higher risk of treatment failure or who have complicated UTI, the length of antibiotic is recommended to be based on the severity of the illness and response to treatment. For most of these residents, 7 days of antibiotic treatment should be adequate if they respond promptly to antibiotics (within 72 hours). Longer (10–14 days) durations are reasonable for residents with severe illness, such as bacteremia, or a delayed response to treatment. The choice of antibiotics also impacts the duration of treatment. For example, when treating complicated UTI, FQs are usually prescribed for 5 to 7 days, TMP-SMX for 7 to 14 days, and oral beta-lactams for 10 to 14 days.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PREVENTION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cranberry Formulations</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cranberry juice has been used as a home remedy for prevention and treatment of UTI for decades, although the evidence to support this intervention as a prevention strategy is still debated. Cranberry proanthocyanidin (PAC) is the active ingredient in cranberry that is thought to inhibit adherence of P-fimbriated <i>E coli </i>to uroepithelial cell receptors.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, a Cochrane review evaluating use of cranberry containing products (ie, juice, tablets, or capsules) did not find significant evidence that any of these products prevented UTI in women compared to placebo, water, or no treatment. Another study examining cranberry capsules containing 36 to 108 mg of PAC found a trend toward a decrease in bacteriuria plus pyuria in LTC residents, suggesting formulations with higher doses of PAC may be beneficial. A systematic review and meta-analysis of only RCTs did conclude that cranberry products reduced UTI recurrence in women with at least three UTIs in a 1-year period (risk ratio [RR] 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33– 0.83). However, because of the substantial heterogeneity across trials, the authors mention that this conclusion should be interpreted with great caution. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized trials came to similar conclusion. They found cranberry reduced the risk of</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">UTI by 26% (pooled RR: 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55–0.98; <i>I</i><span class="s22">2</span> = 54%) in healthy women at risk for UTI. However, most of the studies had small sample size and there were significant limitations due to which the authors noted that larger high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings. Given the issues of volume and glucose load for a cranberry juice supplement and size and cost of cranberry capsules, further investigation of cranberry supplements in older adults is warranted prior to recommending either product as a prevention strategy. Even though more recent urology guidelines stated that clinicians may offer cranberry prophylaxis for recurrent UTI (while acknowledging the limitations), AMDA UTI consensus statement for PALTC setting concluded that current evidence does not support the use of cranberry products for the prevention of UTI.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vaginal Estrogen</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In older adults, declining estrogen levels are thought to lead to declining levels of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract and thus, increase colonization of the perineal area with organisms such as <i>E coli</i>. Topical estrogen appears to be a safe and potentially effective method for prevention of UTI in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">postmenopausal women. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the evidence regarding use of vaginal estrogens as a prevention strategy for recurrent UTI in postmenopausal women. Both RCTs included in this study found that vaginal estrogen (vaginal cream containing 0.5 mg of estriol or vaginal ring with 2 mg estradiol) significantly reduced the risk of UTI in postmenopausal women (RR 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13–0.50; and RR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47–0.86, respectively). However, their pooled effect was not significant (RR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.16–1.10). In one of the study that described significant decrease in incidence of UTI in the vaginal estriol group as compared to placebo group (0.5 vs 5.9 episodes per-patient year, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.001), reported side effects of vaginal estrogen use included vaginal irritation, burning or itching. However, the side effects were described as mild and</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">self-limited. As benefits of vaginal estrogens appear to outweigh potential minor side effect concerns most experts including recent urology guidelines and AMDA UTI consensus statement for PALTC settings recommend considering vaginal estrogen therapy for prevention of recurrent UTI in older women. Vaginal estrogen has not been demonstrated to increase the risk of estrogen-dependent cancer (eg, breast cancer). However, clinicians are recommended to coordinate with patients’ oncologists when considering vaginal estrogen therapy for those who either have personal history or are at high risk for estrogen-dependent cancer.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Suppressive Antibiotics</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, prolonged suppressive antimicrobial therapy for prevention of UTI in older adults should be avoided. It may be considered when there is persistent or recurrent morbidity attributable to UTI. Such circumstances are uncommon, but might include recurrent invasive infection in the presence of an underlying genitourinary abnormality that cannot be corrected, persistent infected stones where suppressive therapy may prevent further stone enlargement, frequent symptomatic recurrences from a prostatic source, or with chronic renal failure. Antimicrobial selection for suppressive therapy is individualized, based on susceptibilities of the infecting organism and tolerance. Deciding whether to use antibiotic prophylaxis must be determined based on the frequency of UTI, severity of symptoms, and possibility of adverse effects of chronic antimicrobial use such as development of <i>Clostridioides difficile </i>colitis, selection of multidrug-resistant organisms and various other adverse drug reactions. Patients should also be made</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aware of the risks and benefits for choosing suppressive antibiotics for prevention of UTI. For many older adults, these risks are likely to outweigh any benefit and suppressive therapy is seldom indicated. More recently, a matched cohort study compared older adults with UTI receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (defined as antibiotic treatment for at least 30 days) that was started within 30 days after a positive urine culture to those who did not receive prophylaxis (but received the treatment). Antibiotic prophylaxis recipients were at higher risk of emergency department visits or hospitalizations for UTI, sepsis or bloodstream infection (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12–1.57), acquisition of antibiotic resistance to any urinary antibiotics (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18–1.44), developing <i>C difficile </i>infections (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.05–2.23), and experiencing general medical adverse events (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.11–2.29). Recent urology guidelines state that clinicians may prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of future UTI but emphasize that all antibiotics have potential risk and the decision to prescribe should follow the discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patients. Recent AMDA UTI consensus statement acknowledges that antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of recurrent uncomplicated cystitis but points out that the potential harms associated with long-term use, coupled with the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms among PALTC residents, argue against long-term antibiotic prophylaxis in these settings.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Antimicrobial Sparing Agents</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the cranberry products and vaginal estrogens, several other agents have been used in clinical practice for prevention of UTI but their benefits remain uncertain. These agents include methenamine salts, probiotics, ascorbic acid, and D-Mannose. A structured review published in 2019 evaluated the available evidence for the use of several nonantibiotic agents to prevent UTI in women 45 years or older concluded that there is a lack of evidence to make recommendations for or against the use of ascorbic acid, cranberry juice, cranberry capsules with high proanthocyanidin content, D-mannose, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and methenamine hippurate. Further studies are needed to clarify the roles of these antimicrobial sparing agents in prevention of UTI among older adults.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prevention of Catheter-Associated UTI</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most effective strategies for prevention of CAUTI are to avoid catheterization and, when an indwelling catheter is indicated, to discontinue the catheter as soon as possible. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee as part of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), issued guidelines in 2009, aimed to help providers with the prevention, diagnosis, and management of persons with CAUTI, particularly hospitalized patients and residents of LTCFs. In older adults that require catheter placement, recommendations include insertion of catheters aseptically by trained personnel, use of the smallest diameter catheter as possible, hand washing before and after catheter manipulation, maintenance of a closed catheter system, avoiding irrigation unless anticipating obstruction (eg, after prostatic or bladder surgery), keeping the collecting bag below the bladder, and maintaining good hydration in residents. The guidelines also recommend against changing indwelling catheters or drainage bags at routine, fixed intervals. Instead, it is suggested to change catheters and drainage bags based on clinical indications such as infection, obstruction, or when the closed system is compromised. The catheter should only be replaced if still indicated. Use of antimicrobial-coated catheters has been shown to delay bacterial colonization and thus reduce the incidence of bacteriuria. However, an RCT evaluating the use of two antibiotic-coated catheters did not find significant benefit in prevention of CAUTI. These catheters are more expensive and thus are likely not beneficial in most clinical settings. Use of a computerized clinical decision support intervention for reducing the duration of catheter use has been shown to be effective in limiting the duration of catheters and CAUTIs in hospitalized patients, although this intervention may be more difficult to implement in LTCFs.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As CAUTIs are the most common health care–associated infection, there have been regulatory changes directed toward incentivizing CAUTI reduction in both hospitals and nursing homes. PALTC settings are paying special attention to incorporating strategies for CAUTI prevention including making sure that residents have an indwelling catheter only when indicated. In one of the observational cohort studies including 228 long-stay residents with an indwelling catheter, 86% had a documented indication for the catheter. Of those 193 residents with a documented indication, 99% had one or more indications deemed appropriate, including urinary retention (83%), pressure ulcer (21%), hospice care (10%), and need for accurate measurement of input and output (6%). Evidence suggest that implementing intervention</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bundles that incorporate technical strategies (focusing on aseptic insertion, catheter maintenance, regular assessments, prompt removal when no longer indicated, and incontinence care planning) and socioadaptive strategies (focusing on effective communication and engaging nursing home leadership, staff, residents and their families in CAUTI prevention efforts) can result in significant reductions in CAUTI especially in those facilities struggling with higher CAUTI rates. When such intervention was implemented in 404 community nursing homes, their adjusted CAUTI rates decreased from 6.42 to 3.33 infections per 1000 catheter days (incidence rate ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36–0.58; <i>p </i>&lt; .001). However, a similar intervention in Veterans Affairs nursing homes did not result in significant change (2.26–3.19 infections per 1000 catheter days; incidence rate ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.67–1.44). The lack of success in further reduction of CAUTI rate was thought to be secondary to lower baseline CAUTI rate in this setting. Therefore, it is important for the nursing home leaders to evaluate their baseline CAUTI rates before dedicating resources specifically to a CAUTI-reduction bundle. Another study evaluated the impact of a multimodal targeted infection prevention program implementation in 12 community nursing homes. The program included active surveillance for infections, ongoing educational programs for staff, hand hygiene promotion, and preemptive barrier precautions for all residents with indwelling devices. This intervention resulted in both decreased MDRO prevalence density and CAUTIs. It provides evidence that CAUTI reduction effort can also be incorporated into more comprehensive infection prevention and control bundle in PALTC settings.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SPECIAL ISSUES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Outcomes</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most healthy older adults with symptomatic UTI respond well to antibiotic therapy. However, bacteriuria is associated with significant morbidity, often related to antibiotic use, which promotes the development of multidrug- resistant bacteria and overgrowth of organisms such as <i>C difficile</i>. Presence of an indwelling catheter, age, and medical comorbidities influence outcomes. CAUTI was associated with a significantly higher mortality in hospitalized adults aged 65 or older compared to UTI in noncatheterized patients (19% vs 11%, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.05). In a retrospective cohort study of residents with UTI in LTCFs in the United States, risk factors that appeared to increase</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the risk of hospitalization included advancing age, Hispanic or African- American race/ethnicity, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson disease, dementia, and stroke. Factors that decreased the risk of hospitalization in this same cohort included the ability to walk, physician visit at the time of admission to a LTCF, and maintaining or improving mobility in those with severe mobility problems. One of the most serious complications of UTI is the development of bacteremia as a consequence of persistent infection causing hematologic spread. Older adults are more likely than younger adults to develop gram- negative bacteremia as a consequence of UTI. The mortality in patients with bacteremic UTI has been described to be between 14% and 33%. However, adults with bacteremia as a result of UTI compared to bacteremia from other etiologies tend to have better outcomes.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antibiotic Resistance</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antibiotic resistance is a large problem in all health care settings including outpatient, PALTC and acute hospital settings. UTI remains the most common reason antibiotics are prescribed in older adults, despite increased awareness of emerging resistance as a result of overtreatment. A substantial proportion of antibiotics are prescribed for asymptomatic infection or presentations without localizing urinary symptoms, fostering the development of increasingly resistant organisms.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Antibiotic resistance in the community </span>Antibiotic resistance is no longer limited to the hospital setting. Primary care providers are responsible for a significant number of antimicrobial prescriptions in community-dwelling older adults and recent antibiotic use in the primary care setting has been shown to be the most important risk factor for development of an infection with a resistant organism. Adults who receive an antibiotic for UTI are over four times more likely to develop a resistant organism within 1 month compared to adults not prescribed an antimicrobial agent. Although the risk is greatest at 1 month, resistance persists for up to 12 months in many patients. A population-based cohort study in Minnesota found the incidence of resistant <i>E coli </i>urinary isolates to FQ plus TMP/SMX in adults aged 80 or older to nearly double over a 4-year period (274–512 per 100,000 person-years, <i>p </i>&lt; 0.05). Despite the increasing awareness of drug-resistant pathogens in the community, overuse with antimicrobials for treatment of UTI remains. Community- dwelling older adults may believe that antibiotic resistance is a hospital- acquired condition and may not fully understand the risks associated with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">each antibiotic prescription. Primary care providers may feel that increasing resistance to antibiotics is largely out of their control. Further studies assessing patient and community physician understanding of antibiotic resistance, particularly as it relates to UTI, are needed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Antibiotic resistance in PALTC se ttings </span>Over the past several years, increased awareness has been placed on infection control practices and ASPs in LTCFs, although inappropriate use of antibiotics remains high in this setting. Prevalence rates of colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been reported to be higher than 50% in some LTCFs. Among all urinary isolates of residents in five nursing homes in Connecticut, 26% were resistant to TMP/SMX, 40% were resistant to FQs, and 25% were resistant to cefazolin. The resistance rates to FQ in only <i>E coli </i>isolates were much higher at nearly 60%. <i>E coli </i>isolates were highly sensitive to nitrofurantoin (93%), although its sensitivity to all organisms was much lower at 68%. Similar to the community setting, high antibiotic prescriptions driving increasing resistance rates continue to be prevalent despite increased awareness. Qualitative studies have characterized some variables, which drive inappropriate antimicrobial use in this setting. When antimicrobial therapy is prescribed, often, nursing personnel are evaluating patients and communicating their findings to physicians. Physicians may not assess patients directly. Nursing personnel (ie, nurses and nurses’ aides) are critical to identifying patients that are suspected of having UTI, requesting urine studies to be sent, and suggesting that antibiotic therapy may be warranted. Interventions focused on educating nursing staff to perform detailed assessment of a resident when a UTI is suspected and improving communication with physicians after assessment have resulted in decreased antibiotic use for the UTI in PALTC settings.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">UTIs are major driver of antibiotic use and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing related to UTI is common in various health care (including acute- care, outpatient, and PALTC) settings. ASPs are designed to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing while reducing the adverse events associated with antibiotic use. CDC has published core elements of antibiotic stewardship programs for different health care settings. For hospitals and nursing homes, there are seven recommended core elements including (1) leadership commitment, (2) accountability, (3) pharmacy</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">expertise (for hospitals)/drug expertise (for nursing homes), (4) action, (5) tracking, (6) reporting, and (7) education. For outpatient antibiotic stewardship, they outlined four core elements including (1) commitment, (2) action for policy and practice, (3) tracking and reporting, and (4) education and expertise. CDC’s core elements of antibiotic stewardship provide a framework that clinicians and health care facilities can use to put in place comprehensive set of interventions that involves reviewing antimicrobial stewardship related data (eg, antibiotic use and outcome data), identifying opportunities for improvement, implementing action plan for improvement in antibiotic prescribing practices, and providing periodic updates and feedback to health care workers on the progress. If the initial evaluation of the data points toward UTI as the major driver of the inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in the facility, then ASP should consider focusing its attention on interventions that can promote appropriate antibiotic use for UTIs. The exact intervention needed may depend on underlying reason for inappropriate prescribing. For example, if antibiotics are being initiated for UTI in scenarios where the patients are not meeting the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of UTI, then introducing an assessment or decision-aid tool prompting clinicians to look for those criteria during initial evaluation will be a good intervention. If the reason for inappropriateness is unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or use for longer than recommended duration, then introducing facility-specific guidance for clinicians outlining the preferred empiric regimen and duration will be helpful. <span class="s1">Figure 106-3 </span>highlights some examples of UTI-focused interventions that can be implemented in various health care settings. Depending on the identified challenges, a combination of interventions might be necessary for reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and improving patient outcomes. One of the recent studies conducted in 25 nursing homes (12 intervention and 13 control) implemented a multifaceted antimicrobial stewardship program focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic use for uncomplicated cystitis.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intervention nursing homes were randomized to receive a 1-hour introductory webinar, posters and pocket-sized educational cards with the diagnostic and treatment guidelines, tools for system change (eg, standardized physician order set forms; and an active monitoring sheet), and educational clinical vignettes addressing the diagnosis and treatment of suspected uncomplicated cystitis. Monthly web-based coaching calls were held for staff of intervention nursing homes and the facilities received quarterly feedback</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reports regarding management of uncomplicated cystitis. Overall antibiotic use was lower and fewer unlikely cystitis cases were treated in the intervention group without any increase in all-cause hospitalizations or death. Furthermore <i>C difficile </i>infection rates were also lower in the intervention as compared to the control nursing homes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 106-3. <span class="s5">Examples of interventions that can be implemented by healthcare settings as part of antibiotic stewardship program.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation and Management of UTI Near End of Life</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antimicrobials are usually overused at end-of-life and in the setting of advanced dementia, often without a known source of infection. That being said, UTIs can carry a heavy symptom burden. Thus, the decision to evaluate symptoms and subsequent management of a confirmed UTI are influenced greatly by the goals of care and life expectancy of the individual. If a patient is able to reliably report symptoms, and is expected to survive long enough to benefit from antimicrobial treatment, it would be appropriate to consider routine care. Enrollment in hospice alone should not be a barrier to receiving work-up and treatment of UTIs. However, antibiotic therapy has risks along with the potential benefits for a patient and should not be presented as a benign treatment plan. A discussion of potential side effects, risk for infection with resistant organisms, and any medical monitoring that is required for the selected antibiotic should be presented so patients can make a well-informed decision.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Advanced dementia, aphasia, or any disease process which interferes with a patient’s ability to provide a reliable history can confound efforts to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">assess symptoms of infection, such as dysuria. If a UTI is suspected, it is important for clinicians to have a good understanding of the patient’s wishes for their care prior to further investigation. Patients or their surrogate decision-makers may have set limits on what treatments they would want in such circumstances. If the goal is comfort, then it may be most appropriate to defer a work-up and focus on palliation of symptoms alone. If no limits have been set, or there is confusion about what a patient may or may not have wanted in this clinical setting, factors such as evidence of the seriousness of the infection, overall life expectancy and likelihood of survival benefit from antimicrobial treatment should be discussed with the medical decision- makers. When deciding against additional work-up and antibiotic treatment for a suspected UTI, focus can be directed toward symptom management strategies.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CONCLUSION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">UTI is the most common infection occurring in older populations. The management of UTI for older ambulatory individuals is similar to younger populations, and determined by the presentation as either acute simple cystitis, complicated UTI or CAUTI. Treatment of symptomatic UTI requires optimal use of urine culture for diagnosis, appropriate antimicrobial selection, and appropriate duration of therapy. In PALTC settings, the very high prevalence of ASB interferes with ascertainment of symptomatic infection, especially in residents without localizing genitourinary symptoms. Bacteriuric older individuals who present with clinical decline without localizing findings should not be assumed to have a urinary source, despite a positive urine culture. A critical approach to diagnosis, investigation, and treatment is necessary. Further characterization of symptomatic presentations of urinary infection in the functionally disabled older population, together with evaluation of management approaches such as nontreatment with observation compared with empiric antimicrobial treatment, is needed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Arinzon Z, Shabat S, Peisakh A, Bemer Y.

HIV destroys CD4+ T cells vital to defense of infections, and when untreated, leads to a progressively immunocompromised state with an increased risk for opportunistic infections, cancers, and other complications.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EPIDEMIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the most amazing success stories of our lifetime is the transformation of HIV infection from a rapidly fatal disease that manifested in the first AIDS cases in early 1980s to a chronic health condition, with this shift driven in part by the tremendous advocacy of the HIV community. With early initiation of effective ART, HIV-1 RNA can now be quickly reduced to undetectable levels. Not only does this decrease the risk of immune suppression and associated comorbidities, but effective ART essentially eradicates between person transmission of HIV. This discovery that Undetectable = Untransmittable (or U = U) has resulted in a transformative experience for many people living with HIV, as they can now live without the fear of transmitting HIV to partners or close contacts. Unfortunately, despite early initiation of ART, we have yet to fully eradicate HIV, with rare exceptions occurring in the setting of bone marrow transplantation. As a result, a growing number of people are now living, and aging, with HIV. In the United States and Europe, as of 2018, over 50% of people living with HIV are age 50 or older, with approximately 20% age 65 or older.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition to aging with HIV, many older adults continue to become newly infected with HIV: more than 15% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States are in adults aged 50 or older. Those aging with HIV are more likely than other aging individuals to use psychoactive substances including alcohol, marijuana, and opioids, which can both interfere with antiretroviral</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adherence and increase higher-risk sexual encounters. Use of medications to treat erectile dysfunction and enhance sexual performance may also increase sexual risk behavior. Additionally, older men are less likely to use condoms and postmenopausal women may be less likely to request barrier protection without the risk of pregnancy. Age-associated erectile changes may make condom use difficult, and age-associated declines in immunity and changes in mucosal barriers may place older individuals at higher risk of transmission with each exposure. Finally, older individuals often present later in the course of HIV disease, extending the period of highest infectivity due to unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is less common among older versus younger adults, PrEP is an extremely effective tool for prevention of HIV transmission among patients at risk of HIV acquisition.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Efficacy is presumed to be similar among older adults; however, few studies have included older adults, and the risk of adverse events and toxicity may be higher. A combination of strategies (barrier protection, ensuring viral suppression among people with diagnosed HIV, and providing PrEP to people at risk for HIV) has decreased and can continue to decrease transmission of new cases of HIV.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Screening</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No one is immune to HIV infection, and nearly 15% of people with HIV (PWH) in the United States and approximately 45% of persons worldwide are unaware of their diagnosis, presenting the greatest transmission risk. The nonspecific or asymptomatic presentation of new HIV may lead to a missed diagnosis for months or even years, as physicians and their patients are both likely to underestimate the risk of HIV infection among older adults. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of HIV decreases transmission and improves outcomes across the age spectrum. U = U has also led to a greater emphasis on the HIV care continuum: ensuring that each person living with HIV is diagnosed, linked to and receives care, is retained in care overtime, and achieves viral suppression.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommend that adolescents and adults aged 13 to 64 (CDC) or 15 to 65 (USPSTF) and all pregnant women</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should have HIV screening at least once; other expert panels (including the American College of Physicians) recommend screening up to age 75. More frequent annual testing is recommended for adults with higher risk, including persons who use injection drugs; have sex with a partner who has HIV or unknown HIV status, or uses injection drugs; and men who have sex with men. An individual in a monogamous relationship may present with a sexually transmitted disease because their partner has more than one partner; any patient with a sexually transmitted disease (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, or trichomonas) should be screened (or rescreened) for HIV. Older patients may not spontaneously report sexual or drug use behaviors, and physicians seldom ask. Notably, some older patients may assume that HIV testing is part of routine blood work, thus incorrectly believe they are regularly tested. Annual wellness visits or hospitalizations are opportunities to ensure that HIV testing is up-to-date and repeated if indicated. Specific signed consent is no longer required for HIV testing though verbal consent may be required in some states.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition to routine testing, HIV testing should be conducted as part of a diagnostic work-up in any patient with unexplained laboratory results (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, transaminitis, hyperproteinemia); new diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy, oral candidiasis, herpes zoster, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, anal cancer; or any AIDS-associated conditions</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(<i>Pneumocystis jiroveci </i>pneumonia, Kaposi sarcoma, atypical mycobacterial infection, tuberculosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Finally, any patient presenting with debilitating fatigue, weight loss, or cognitive changes should be tested for HIV.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HIV Testing</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In most clinical settings, the prior two-step ELISA (antibody) and Western blot testing strategy has been replaced by a fourth-generation combination HIV-1/2 immunoassay that tests for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and the HIV p24 antigen. If positive, a confirmatory immunoassay will distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2 (primarily found in Africa). If there is any concern for recently acquired HIV infection, based on recent exposure or symptoms (fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy), the immunoassay should be combined with a PCR test for HIV-1 viral load as the p24 antigen will not turn positive until approximately 5 to 7 days after the HIV-1 viral load is detectable. Both false-negative and false-positive tests are now extremely rare with the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">combined antibody/antigen test. Rapid screening tests (including home kits) detect antibody only and have a higher rate of false negative results.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MANAGEMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Selection and Initiation of Antiretroviral Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients with a new HIV diagnosis should be connected to HIV care as quickly as possible. ART is recommended for any patient regardless of CD4+ T-cell count, with greatest benefit on long-term prognosis seen if the CD4+ count remains more than 500 cells/μL. Rapid treatment of HIV offers immediate benefit by preventing declines in CD4+ count and decreasing HIV transmission. Indeed, some HIV programs have instituted rapid start programs with initiation of ART on the same day of HIV testing. Data also suggest that rapid initiation of ART with lower peak HIV-1 viral loads may decrease the “reservoir” of HIV that is difficult to eradicate and may have added benefits on long-term inflammation and immune alterations with aging. Older adults appear to adhere more effectively to ART and are quite successful at achieving HIV-1 RNA suppression, but experience a slower improvement in CD4+ cell count, thus even more emphasis is placed on early initiation. Without treatment, the natural history of HIV infection is usually one of progressive immunodeficiency, with development of symptomatic AIDS approximately 8 to 12 years after infection. Prognosis is poorer among those who present late for care, fail to adhere to their treatment regimen, and/or develop widely resistant virus.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Standard ART regimens require medications from at least two different classes, most commonly an integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) combined with one or two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Compared to older antiretrovirals, contemporary regimens have less adverse effects, fewer drug–drug interactions, rapid viral suppression, and are generally tolerant of minor variations in adherence. Furthermore, many of the regimens are available in a single coformulated tablet once a day. Long-acting injectable drugs also have promising data on adherence and acceptability, though with very limited data among older populations.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notably, while ART appears safe in older populations and is essential in the prevention of disease progression, very few adults older than age 60 were included in clinical trials.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">There are many antiretrovirals from which to choose, and this selection should be informed by consultation with an experienced HIV care provider. Selection of a regimen incorporates likelihood of resistance (and HIV-1 genotyping if available), cost, patient preference, comorbidities, preexisting organ system injury and anticipated toxicity, and concomitant medications.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patients are followed closely for the first several months of therapy to ensure tolerability, safety, and HIV-1 viral load suppression. After the first 6 to 12 months of therapy, if viral suppression is achieved and the patient has a CD4+ count above 350 to 500 cells/mL, HIV-1 viral load monitoring can occur approximately every 6 months and CD4+ count annually or less. While selection of antiretroviral regimens should be informed by an experienced HIV provider, once patients have achieved HIV-1 viral load suppression, care could be managed by a primary care provider or geriatrician with consultation as needed.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Many toxicities with ART are predictable. Weight gain is common with any regimen, but appears to be more common and significant with newer antiretroviral regimens. While some weight gain may be beneficial among those who are underweight, in many, weight gain is associated with incident hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis. Thus, all patients initiating ART should be provided general nutrition and physical activity recommendations to avoid excess weight gain. Physical activity prescriptions specific for adults with HIV have been developed and can be given at the time of ART to provide strategies to maintain adequate levels of physical activity.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Care Considerations for the Older Adult With HIV</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After antiretroviral initiation, the incidence of AIDS conditions drops dramatically, but ongoing and consistent therapy is imperative. The Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trial demonstrated that continued viral suppression decreases incident non-AIDS conditions including liver disease, kidney disease, lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. Even with early initiation of ART, PWH experience some comorbidities many years before their uninfected peers (accelerated), or with a much higher prevalence than their uninfected peers (accentuated). This concept of accelerated versus accentuated aging is particularly important for diseases that might occur earlier and require a change in screening recommendations (eg, low bone density, falls, frailty, some cancers), and for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">diseases that occur more frequently and may require particular vigilance for monitoring and aggressive management (eg, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers). With the earlier manifestation of many diseases, a threshold of 50 years has been used for characterizing “aging” with HIV. As the population of people older than 60 or 65 years continues to grow, it will be important to also study effects of HIV among those of more advanced age.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Potential mechanisms underlying accelerated or accentuated aging in PWH include immune dysfunction, dysregulation, and suppression; chronic inflammatory stimulation due to reservoirs of HIV-1 RNA replication and chronic microbial translocation; hypercoagulability; and direct effects of viral proteins, modifiable lifestyle factors, and social or structural determinants of health. Many of the immune system changes of senescence in aging mirror the changes seen with HIV. Furthermore, markers of aging such as DNA methylation patterns and shortened telomere length indicate that PWH are approximately 5 years older, biologically, than their HIV- uninfected peers. Those who acquire HIV infection often have had years of struggle with structural inequalities (homelessness; biases due to race, ethnic, and gender minority populations; employment; insurance), contributing to additional stress-related immune responses.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">While these mechanistic changes may occur to some extent among almost all PWH, the disease process, immune system alterations, and comorbidities of someone who has lived with HIV for over 30 years may be much different than someone diagnosed more recently and started on therapy immediately.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The “legacy” effect of immune suppression, opportunistic infections, and exposure to older, toxic ART may be long-lasting. In contrast, those that survived the early years of HIV, while experiencing the stress and trauma of the AIDS epidemic, may also have a unique “survivor” effect. Individuals who are diagnosed early in their disease process, achieve and maintain excellent HIV-1 RNA suppression, do not gain excess weight after ART initiation, and avoid ongoing substance use are likely to experience a very different aging trajectory from those who do not.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Models of Geriatric HIV Care</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accompanying an increasing number of older adults with HIV is, unfortunately, a shortage of both HIV and geriatric medicine clinic providers. In addition to routine clinic-based care, people aging with HIV are substantially more likely to be hospitalized than their HIV-uninfected peers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How these patients and their many transitions between inpatient and outpatient care, general medical care and specialty care, and skilled nursing facility care will best be managed in the future remains to be seen.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Incorporation of telehealth or telephone consultation for geriatric, HIV, or other subspecialty care may be an important component of care in the future. Similarly, HIV providers should have appropriate training in geriatric medicine, and geriatric care providers in HIV medicine. What is nearly certain is that older PWH will place new demands on parts of the health care system, including short- and long-term nursing facilities that have previously not managed those with HIV infection in any substantial numbers.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While the management of most diseases will be the same among older PWH, providers should be cognizant of diseases that occur more frequently or manifest differently in HIV. As in other geriatric populations, consideration of the 5 M’s approach to care can prioritize key clinical issues among many PWH, with a focus on Mind, Multimorbidity, Medications, Mobility, and (what) Matters most. We have proposed adding a sixth M for modifiable, emphasizing the importance of addressing the still <i>modifiable </i>factors in a population that might be younger than the typical geriatric population.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Mind <span class="p">incorporates cognitive impairment, mood disorders, the impact of substance use, and the added impact of stressors such as HIV stigma, loneliness, and depression. PWH have almost a fivefold risk for developing cognitive impairment independent of age, and may experience both HIV- related impairments and age-associated cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, and vascular dementia. Up to 50% of PWH (of any age) will have evidence of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment on neuropsychiatric testing, and approximately one-quarter experience an impact on daily function. Importantly, the Mini- Mental State Examination may miss the executive function impairment most common in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders; the Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a more sensitive screening tool, though formal neuropsychiatric testing is generally recommended. Although HIV disease severity (low CD4+ count, high HIV-1 RNA) is strongly linked to HIV- associated neurocognitive disorder, the impairments have changed minimally despite early and consistent ART; comorbidities, medication toxicity, psychiatric disease, and substance use also play an important role.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Depression, anxiety, and severe mental illnesses such as psychosis and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">posttraumatic stress disorder are more common among older PWH infection than among the general population, with depression occurring in over 50% of PWH in some cohorts. Mood disorders can overlap with and confound the diagnosis of cognitive impairment, thus teasing out the diagnosis of both can be challenging. PWH who are aged 50 or older are also more likely than uninfected demographic counterparts to consume hazardous amounts of alcohol, use illicit drugs (especially marijuana, cocaine, and opioids), and smoke cigarettes. Lastly, social isolation, loneliness, and HIV-related stigma are highly prevalent among older PWH and may contribute to both poor cognition and mental health.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">PWH experience a greater burden of <i>multimorbidity </i>at a given age than other populations, particularly in regard to clusters of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. These disease clusters may be linked to toxicities of older ART, weight gain associated with newer therapy, and chronic inflammation. Kidney disease and loss of bone density are particularly common with some ART regimens and may occur as a consequence of coinfection with hepatitis B or C. The risk of some cancers is heightened due to coinfection with oncogenic viruses (human papilloma virus and anal cancer), exposure to carcinogens (lung cancer and smoking), or immunosuppression (some lymphomas). When referring to specialists, it is important to recognize that many older PWH continue to experience stigma related to HIV, gender, sexual preference, and age, and may be resistant to evaluation in a new clinic with a new provider.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">With the initiation of ART, <i>multiple medications </i>or polypharmacy becomes the “norm” among PWH, often at least a decade before those without HIV experience polypharmacy. In addition to the burden of daily medications and pill fatigue, many antiretroviral agents are associated with significant drug–drug interactions. The protease inhibitors are particularly problematic, increasing levels of some concomitant medications (such atorvastatin) by over 800%. With the introduction of newer ART, treatment guidelines have emphasized a shift away from certain medication classes, particularly among older PWH, to avoid these often dangerous drug interactions. Interactions with food, vitamins, and both prescription and nonprescription medications can still occur with almost any of the HIV medications and careful attention to possible drug interactions should be considered with any new prescription or change in dose. Further, due to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">preexisting organ system injury among those with HIV, those with HIV infection may be particularly susceptible to the harms associated with polypharmacy. These harms include decreased medication adherence and increased serious adverse drug events including organ system injury, hospitalization, geriatric syndromes (falls, fractures, and cognitive decline), and all-cause mortality. Utilizing pharmacists and drug–drug interactions programs (eg, <span style=" color: #0000ED;">HIV-druginteractions.org</span>) can be extremely helpful.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Mobility <span class="p">tends to decline at a faster rate among PWH compared to uninfected controls, with differences apparent as early as age 50. Even among those with early initiation of ART, impairments in measures of grip strength, lower extremity function (repeat chair stands), and balance are common. The effects of ART on mitochondria, inflammation, neuropathy, obesity, and sarcopenia are heightened further by the impact of comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and physical inactivity. Importantly, mobility impairments in middle-aged and older PWH are linked strongly to poor outcomes, including increased morbidity, mortality, and risk of falls. Indeed, people aged 45 to 65 with HIV experience fall rates similar to populations aged 65 and older without HIV. Many of the mobility impairments can be attenuated with cardiovascular and strength training.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thus physical activity counseling and fall risk reduction should be an important component of the care of PWH, regardless of age.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ultimately, care should address what <i>Matters Most </i>to the patient.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recommendations should be informed by prognosis and the added risk/benefit ratio. Greater comorbid burden, frailty, and cognitive impairment among a relatively younger PWH may limit the added benefit of a screening procedure or intervention; other older adults with HIV may have robust health with few comorbidities. For example, patients need to live at least 5 to 7 years after screening for the benefit of the screening (decreased mortality) from colon cancer to outweigh the risk of perforation and the pain and discomfort of the procedure. Conversely, more aggressive screening for anal cancer may be indicated, particularly among those with good health, because of the increased incidence of this condition among those with HIV infection. Thus, “age appropriate” primary care guidelines for those without HIV may differ among PWH—careful consideration for the individual’s prognosis, preferences for care, and personal risk of these conditions should be incorporated in the conversation. What matters most in the care of an older PWH may be impacted considerably by loss, trauma, and stigma.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Importantly, these conversations and designated decision makers should be carefully documented. Less than half of patients in most HIV clinics have completed any form of advanced care planning. Many PWH in the United States have estranged relationships with family and have same sex partners or close friends that they would prefer to designate as a medical power of attorney. As the recognition of these decision makers can differ by state, addressing advanced directives and designating medical power of attorney among older PWH is even more important to ensure the right person can help to make the right choices at the end of life.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Lastly, <i>modifiable </i>risk factors should be a key component of the care of PWH throughout the lifespan. Some older PWH may continue to engage high- risk sexual behaviors and have frequent exposures to sexually transmitted infections (STIs); safer sex and decreasing long-acting consequences of STIs, including syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Food insecurity is up to six times more common in older adults with HIV, and loneliness occurs in nearly 60% of older adults with HIV: ensuring access to nutritious food and connecting with social resources may improve multiple domains of health.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As previously mentioned, consistent ART adherence and adequate levels of physical activity remain key components of care for all PWH.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In summary, people aged 50 or older now account for a majority of PWH as a consequence of improved lifespan of those with HIV and increased acquisition of HIV at older ages. Older adults should be screened for HIV at least once, and more often if sexual risk is unknown or the patient has nonspecific symptoms. As a consequence of biobehavioral factors, HIV or ART-associated factors, structural inequalities, and the impact of aging- related factors, PWH experience a greater burden of comorbidities and develop geriatric syndromes, often at a much earlier age than their HIV- uninfected peers. A 6 M’s approach to the older PWH may guide providers in prioritizing care components (<span class="s1">Figure 107-1</span>). Importantly, the study of HIV infection among aging individuals may provide a template for improving the management of complex chronic disease more generally, especially among special populations of aging individuals—people of color, sexual minorities, and those with limited socioeconomic resources.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 107-1. <span class="s5">Underlying factors influencing development of comorbidities and geriatric syndromes and considerations to the approach of care of the older adult with HIV.

Herpes zoster is characterized by unilateral, dermatomal pain and rash. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is pain 90 or more days after rash onset.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EPIDEMIOLOGY</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">VZV Transmission</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">VZV is a double-stranded DNA herpesvirus that is transmitted from person to person via direct contact or airborne or droplet nuclei when a virus-naive individual is exposed to the vesicular rash of varicella or herpes zoster.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These exposed individuals may then develop varicella. Health care workers and staff in nursing homes and hospitals and children who have not received the varicella vaccine may not have had VZV primary infection and are potentially at risk for varicella. However, nearly all older adults are seropositive and latently infected with VZV. The exposure of a latently infected individual to herpes zoster does not cause herpes zoster or varicella. All cases of herpes zoster are caused by the reactivation of endogenous VZV.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Herpes Zoster Incidence and Risk Factors</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general population studies from North America and Europe, the estimated incidence of herpes zoster in persons older than age 65 varies from approximately 10 to 14 cases per 1000 per year. The lifetime incidence of herpes zoster is estimated to be about 30% in the general population and may be as high as 50% among those surviving to 85 years or older. Current population figures and herpes zoster incidence data yield estimates of about 1 million new cases of herpes zoster each year in the United States.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The cardinal epidemiological feature of herpes zoster is its increase in incidence with aging and with diseases and drugs that impair cellular immunity. The increase in the likelihood of herpes zoster with aging starts around 50 to 60 years of age and increases into late life in individuals older than 80 years (<span class="s1">Figure 107-2</span>). Immunocompromised patients at risk for herpes zoster include persons with HIV infection, Hodgkin disease, non- Hodgkin lymphomas, leukemia, hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant, systemic lupus erythematosus, and those taking immunosuppressive medications. Other risk factors include White race, female sex, psychological stress, and physical trauma.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 107-2. <span class="s5">Age-specific incidence rate of herpes zoster in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PRESENTATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">VZV reactivates in the affected sensory ganglion and spreads in the peripheral sensory nerve, causing prodromal symptoms that frequently precede the rash by several days. These prodromal symptoms are located in the involved dermatome and range from a superficial itching, tingling, or burning to severe, deep, boring, or lancinating pain, paresthesia, or hyperesthesia. The pain can be constant or intermittent. The prodrome may be mistaken for many other conditions in older adults, including pleurisy, a myocardial infarction, cholecystitis, appendicitis, renal colic, a collapsed intervertebral disk, glaucoma, trigeminal neuralgia, or unappreciated trauma. The prodromal symptoms usually last a few days, although they have been reported to last more than a week. Zoster sine herpete is a condition when patients experience acute dermatomal neuralgia without ever developing a skin eruption.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">When VZV reaches the dermis and epidermis, the initial cutaneous presentation of herpes zoster occurs as a unilateral, dermatomal, red, maculopapular eruption. Vesicles generally form within 24 hours and evolve into pustules, which dry and crust in 7 to 10 days. The rash usually heals over in 2 to 4 weeks. In normal individuals, new lesions may continue to appear for 1 to 4 days and occasionally for as long as 7 days. The T1 to L2 or V1 dermatomes are most commonly involved (<span class="s1">Figure 107-3</span>). Atypical rashes may occur in older persons. The atypical rash may be limited to a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">small patch located within a dermatome or may remain maculopapular without ever developing vesicles.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">FIGURE 107-3. <span class="s5">A patient with herpes zoster illustrates a range of lesions (eg, vesicles, populates, and crusting).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Herpes zoster–associated acute neuritis produces dermatomal neuralgic pain in many older adults. Some older patients never develop pain, while others may experience the delayed onset of pain days or weeks after rash onset. The neuritis is described as burning, deep aching, tingling, itching, or stabbing. A subset of patients may develop severe pain, especially those with trigeminal nerve involvement. Acute herpes zoster pain can interfere with all activities of daily living (ADLs), but interference is greatest for instrumental ADLs, as well as sleep, general physical activity, and leisure activities. As overall pain burden increases, patients experience poorer physical, role, and emotional functioning.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The most feared complication of herpes zoster among older adults is PHN. PHN patients describe the quality of their pain as burning, throbbing, stabbing, shooting, sharp, aching, gnawing, tiring, or tender. The pain may be spontaneous and/or stimulus-evoked. Spontaneous pain may be constant aching or burning and/or brief, intermittent shock-like sensations. Stimulus-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evoked pain consists of allodynia or hyperpathia. Allodynia is pain elicited by an innocuous stimulus and is particularly problematic. A cold wind, clothes, or bed sheets against the allodynic skin may cause debilitating pain. Hyperpathia is an exaggerated pain after a mildly painful stimulus. A minor bump of the affected dermatome against an object can cause severe pain that lasts for hours. Patients may experience discomfort that is not described as pain such as numbness or itching. Postherpetic itch can be maddening and appears to be mediated by damage and dysfunction of peripheral and central itch-specific neurons.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">PHN greatly interferes with the functional status and quality of life of older adults. Patients can suffer from a variety of constitutional symptoms including chronic fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and insomnia. PHN is associated with depression and social isolation in older adults. Reduced quality of life and interference with ADLs increase significantly as pain severity increases. Instrumental and basic ADLs are all compromised by PHN. For example, the patient with allodynic skin may be forced to avoid bathing or clothing around the affected area. Instrumental ADLs commonly affected include traveling, shopping, cooking, and housework. Studies using standardized pain scales and measures of function and quality of life such as the SF-36, SF-12, EuroQol, and Nottingham Health Profile have shown that PHN significantly interferes with multiple ADLs, reduces health-related quality of life (HRQL), and impairs mental and physical health.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Other complications include ocular inflammation in the setting of ophthalmic herpes zoster, cranial neuropathies, myelitis, visceral involvement, and motor paralysis. VZV-induced damage to the cornea and uvea and other eye structures can cause corneal anesthesia and ulceration, glaucoma, optic neuritis, eyelid scarring and retraction, visual impairment, and blindness in patients who did not receive antiviral therapy. Ophthalmic herpes zoster is also associated with stroke occurring weeks to months after the onset of the rash. Involvement of the third division of cranial nerve V can produce lesions and pain in the mandibular area of the face and in the mouth. Cranial nerve VII and VIII involvement, or Ramsey Hunt syndrome, is characterized by facial palsy in combination with herpes zoster lesions of the ipsilateral external ear, ear canal, tympanic membrane, or hard palate.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Symptoms include tinnitus, vertigo, deafness, problems with balance, and facial paresis. Involvement of cranial nerves IX and X may produce pharyngeal or laryngeal lesions and resulting pharyngitis or laryngitis. Motor</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">paralysis, from VZV-induced destruction of motor neurons in the anterior spinal horn or motor radiculitis corresponding to the extension of VZV infection from the involved sensory ganglion, involves muscle groups with innervation that is contiguous with that of the affected dermatome. Painful Bell palsy in an older adult strongly suggests herpes zoster.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EVALUATION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In patients who present with prodromal pain and no rash, herpes zoster is often confused with other causes of unilateral, localized pain in older adults. One diagnostic clue to the presence of prodromal pain is localized cutaneous sensory abnormalities (eg, hyperesthesia, dysesthesia) in the affected dermatome. Herpes zoster is easily diagnosed when an older adult patient presents with the typical dermatomal vesicular rash and pain. During the rash phase, herpes simplex has the most similar presentation to herpes zoster.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evidence supporting herpes simplex includes a presentation in a younger population, multiple reoccurrences of lesions, and the absence of chronic pain. The lesions themselves are more difficult to distinguish, particularly when herpes zoster occurs in areas commonly affected by simplex (eg, oral, genital, buttock lesions). The differential diagnosis also includes contact dermatitis, burns, and vesicular lesions associated with fungal infections, but the history and examination usually make the distinction clear.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis of herpes zoster may need laboratory diagnostic testing when differentiating herpes zoster from HSV infection is necessary, for suspected organ involvement, and for atypical presentations, particularly in the immunocompromised host. The preferred diagnostic test is PCR because it is highly sensitive and specific, and results are available within hours of specimen receipt. The best specimen is vesicle fluid, which contains abundant VZV. Lacking vesicle fluid, acceptable specimens include lesion scrapings, crusts, tissue biopsy, or cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MANAGEMENT</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Acute Herpes Zoster</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The principal goal of the treatment of herpes zoster in older adults is to decrease the length of the acute attack and to reduce or eliminate pain. Patients should be instructed to keep the rash clean and dry to decrease the chances of developing bacterial superinfection. Cool compresses, calamine</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lotion, cornstarch, or baking soda may help to reduce local symptoms and speed the drying of the vesicles.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antiviral Therapy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The guanosine analogs acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase to a triphosphate form that inhibits VZV DNA polymerase and VZV replication (<span class="s1">Table 107-1</span>). Valaciclovir and famciclovir are prodrugs, which have greater bioavailability, resulting in higher blood levels and a less frequent dosing schedule. Randomized controlled trials indicate that oral acyclovir (800 mg five times a day for 7 days), famciclovir (500 mg every 8 hours for 7 days), and valaciclovir (1 g three times a day for 7 days) reduce acute pain and the duration of chronic pain in older patients with herpes zoster who are treated within 72 hours of rash onset. The most common adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. The effectiveness of antiviral agents has not been evaluated for treatment after 72 hours have elapsed since the onset of rash. An exception to the 72-hour threshold for treatment is made for patients who have ophthalmic zoster or patients that continue to have new vesicle formation. Topical antiviral therapy is not an effective treatment regardless of when started.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 107-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>ANTIVIRAL TREATMENT OF HERPES ZOSTER IN IMMUNOCOMPETENT AND IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PERSONS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analgesics</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Acute herpes zoster pain requires the use of standardized pain measures, scheduled analgesia, and close monitoring to adjust dosing and detect adverse effects. Opioid and nonopioid analgesia are a standard of care for the acute pain syndrome. The choice of treatment will depend on the patient’s pain intensity, comorbidities, and preferences. Patients with mild pain may be managed with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal agents. Patients with moderate to severe pain usually require treatment with an opioid analgesic (eg, oxycodone).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corticosteroids</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids have been postulated to reduce herpes zoster symptoms but there remains controversy over their use.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Randomized, controlled clinical trials demonstrated that corticosteroids do not prevent PHN when compared to placebo or acyclovir. These findings, the risk of VZV dissemination, and the adverse effects of corticosteroids in older adults argue against the routine use of these agents in herpes zoster. However, clinical trials have shown reductions in acute pain and one randomized controlled trial showed benefits in improvement in time to uninterrupted sleep, return to routine activities, and cessation of analgesic medications among patients with no relative contraindications to corticosteroids. In the trial, prednisone was administered orally at 60 mg/day for days 1 to 7, 30 mg/day for days 8 to 14, and 15 mg/day for days 15 to 21. Therefore, corticosteroids may be useful in reducing moderate to severe acute pain unrelieved by antiviral agents and analgesics. Corticosteroids are used to treat VZV-induced facial paralysis and cranial polyneuritis to improve motor outcomes and provide pain relief. If prescribed, corticosteroids should always be used in conjunction with antiviral agents.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjuvant Agents</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If moderate-to-severe herpes zoster pain is inadequately relieved by antiviral agents in combination with oral analgesic medications and/or corticosteroids, then other therapies to consider include gabapentin or pregabalin or neural blockade. The use of these anticonvulsant agents must be balanced against adverse effects of sedation, dizziness, ataxia, and peripheral edema. A randomized controlled trial of antiviral therapy, oral analgesics, and a single epidural block with bupivacaine and methylprednisolone compared to antiviral therapy and oral analgesics alone showed that neural blockade reduces acute pain but does not prevent PHN.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Ophthalmic zoster with ocular involvement requires ophthalmological consultation. Oral antiviral and analgesic therapy is the mainstay of treatment as it is for herpes zoster presenting on the rest of the body but other ocular therapies may be necessary. These treatments are best managed by an ophthalmologist and include antibiotic ophthalmic ointment to prevent bacterial infection of the ocular surface, topical steroids to reduce ocular inflammation, mydriatics as needed for iritis, and ocular pressure-lowering drugs as needed for glaucoma.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PREVENTION</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recombinant Zoster Vaccine</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix©) is a powerful tool to prevent herpes zoster and PHN in older adults. It contains two components: recombinant VZV surface glycoprotein E (gE) antigen and the AS01B adjuvant system. AS01B adjuvant contains monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS-21, a saponin, combined in a liposomal formulation. VZV gE elicits an immune response against VZV, while the adjuvant strongly potentiates the immune response by enhancing the innate immune response to the antigen.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Efficacy</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The efficacy of RZV was demonstrated in over 30,000 immunocompetent community-dwelling elders in the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Zoster Efficacy Study in Adults 50 Years of Age or Older (ZOE-50) and Zoster Efficacy Study in Adults 70 Years of Age or Older (ZOE-70) (<span class="s1">Figure 107-4</span>). The intervention was two doses of RZV at a 2-month interval. The median follow-up time was 3.2 years in the ZOE-50 study and 3.7 years in the ZOE-70 study. The vaccine efficacy (VE) for the prevention of herpes zoster was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 89.6–99.3) in persons aged 50–59 and 97% (95% CI = 90.1–99.7) in persons aged 60–69 (see <span class="s1">Figure</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">107-3<span class="p">).

Serious adverse events, potential immune mediated diseases, and deaths were reported at similar rates in vaccine and placebo groups in the clinical trials.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Using pooled data from the ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 trial from all participants, the most common solicited adverse reactions after RZV administration were injection site pain (78%), myalgia (45%), fatigue (45%), headache (38%), shivering (27%), fever (21%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (17%). <span class="s1">Table 107-2 </span>shows the frequency of adverse reactions by age group.

However, participants who experienced a grade 3 reaction after either dose had a transient clinically important decrease in physical functioning and quality of life, affecting activities such as walking distances, carrying groceries, climbing stairs, lifting items, and moderate to vigorous activities. The impact was noted on days 1 to 2 post vaccination and resolved by day 3.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Given that frailty is strongly associated with adverse health outcomes, investigators studied how frailty impacts RZV VE, immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety. In secondary analyses of ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 studies, a baseline frailty index (FI) was created retrospectively following</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">previously validated methods using preexisting comorbidities and patient reported outcomes. Participants were categorized as nonfrail (FI ≤ 0.08), prefrail (FI = 0.08–0.25), or frail (FI ≥ 0.25) for stratified analyses. RZV VE against HZ was consistently above 90% for all frailty categories (nonfrail: 96% [95% CI: 91.6–98.2], prefrail: 90% [84.4–94.4], frail: 90% [75.4–</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">97.0]). The RZV group demonstrated robust antibody responses postdose 2 across frailty categories. In the RZV group, the percentage of participants reporting postvaccination reactions decreased with increasing frailty.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Guidance</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the CDC recommends RZV for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications in immunocompetent adults aged 50 or older including individuals who previously received zoster vaccine live (ZVL; Zostavax©). RZV is included in the routine adult immunization schedule for older adults.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The lyophilized VZV gE antigen is reconstituted with the liquid adjuvant to comprise the vaccine and administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection. RZV is administered in a 2-dose series. Screening for a prior history of varicella or herpes zoster before administration of the first dose is not necessary. After the first dose, the second dose should be administered 2 to 6 months later. If the patient does not return within that time window, then the second dose should be administered at the next available opportunity. It is not necessary to restart the series. RZV may be coadministered with influenza, pneumococcal, and Tdap vaccines.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">It is essential to counsel the patient about potential injection site and systemic reactions before administering both doses of RZV. They may feel pain, redness swelling at the injection site or muscle pain, tiredness, headache, chills, fever or nausea. About one in six persons have reactions that transiently prevent them from doing normal activities. Most symptoms resolve in 1 to 3 days. Patients should be counseled to avoid strenuous activities for a few days after vaccination. Reactions to the first dose do not strongly predict reactions to the second dose.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The ACIP provides no recommendation, either for or against, the use of RZV in immunocompromised populations. The FDA label does not list immunocompromised as a contraindication or precaution so administering RZV to immunocompromised individuals is not off-label prescribing to persons 50 years and older; it is off-label for persons younger than 50 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Currently, best practice is to allow for RZV use in immunocompromised persons on a case-by-case basis if potential benefit is judged to outweigh the risk, using shared decision. Current information from randomized controlled trials indicate that RZV was immunogenic and had no safety concerns in small numbers (100–1000) of different immunocompromised populations including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), kidney transplant, hematologic malignancies, solid cancers on chemotherapy, HIV, and immune- mediated disease. RZV VE was demonstrated prospectively in HSCT (VE = 68%) and in post-hoc analyses in hematologic malignancies (VE = 87%) and immune-mediated diseases (VE = 91%).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HIV</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">American Academy of HIV Medicine: HIV &amp; Aging Clinical Recommendations.

Each year, it is estimated that influenza alone is associated with the death of 36,000 older adults in the United States. Despite immunization, outbreaks of influenza occur regularly in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. This section of the chapter summarizes the biological, epidemiological, and clinical features of influenza that are relevant to older adults, with a particular emphasis on prevention.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinically Relevant Biological Characteristics of Influenza Virus</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To understand the impact of influenza in older adults, it is important to be familiar with several key characteristics of the virus. The structure of influenza consists of an envelope with a central nucleic acid core composed of single-stranded RNA that encodes key structural proteins of the virus including hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. However, only A and B are clinically relevant. Influenza A viruses are characterized by the structure of the hemagglutinin, a surface protein that binds glycoprotein on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells, allowing the virus to enter by forming an endosome and then using the protein-making machinery of the cell to replicate itself. Each year, new mutations occur resulting in small changes in the hemagglutinin (“antigenic drift”) hence the reason why influenza vaccine needs to be reformulated and given annually. The other surface projection,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">neuraminidase, cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from carbohydrate moieties on surfaces of infected cells, promoting the release of virions that go on to infect other cells. As discussed below, this is a key target for neuraminidase inhibitors, thus preventing the influenza virus from replicating.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">An important feature of influenza is the segmented structure of the RNA at the core of the virus, with each of eight segments coding for a structural or enzymatic component of the virus. This gives the virus the potential to recombine with influenza viruses of animal origin, forming a virus with a novel genotype and hemagglutinin to which there is no preexisting immunity. This is known as “antigenic shift” and was responsible for pandemics in 1957–1958, 1968–1969, and 2009. Of note, the highest mortality rates occurring in the 1918–1919 and the 2009 pandemics were not in older adults but in younger adults, perhaps due to cross protection from the many influenza strains to which older adults were exposed over a lifetime.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, mortality in interpandemic periods is highest in those at the extremes of age. At present, there are only three hemagglutinins (H1, H2, and H3) and two neuraminidases (N1 and N2) that have developed a stable lineage in humans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning Objectives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><ul id="l99"><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Understand the biology of influenza virus that leads to “drift” and “shift” in surface protein structure and their impact on vaccine formulation and the emergence of influenza pandemics.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Recognize clinical situations where there is a need for diagnostic testing to confirm a specific viral etiology in symptomatic older adults and recommend the specific tests appropriate in different clinical scenarios.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Identify appropriate interventions to control outbreaks of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a nursing home.</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Recognize the appropriate use of antiviral therapies for influenza in seniors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Clinical Points</p><h3 style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">1.

In any given season, there may be several strains circulating, hence the annual influenza vaccine contains multiple influenza strains.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Important Host Considerations in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the interpandemic period, older adults and particularly residents of long-term care facilities are equally likely to contract influenza as young, healthy adults, but are among those at highest risk for complications of influenza. Rates of hospitalization for influenza in older persons range from 136 to 508 per 100,000 persons versus 10 to 25 for those 5 to 49 years of age. The presence of chronic conditions, such as chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, conditions that predispose to aspiration, and metabolic disease, increases the risk for complications following infection with influenza. Many of these conditions occur predominately in older age groups. Moreover, studies that have assessed complications have found that age older than 65 is independently associated with increased risk for influenza complications.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Based on our current understanding, the causes of death as a result of influenza in older adults in the interpandemic period include viral pneumonia, a bacterial infection complicating the influenza infection, myocardial infarction, stroke, and exacerbation of underlying comorbid conditions. Infection with influenza virus predisposes to <i>Streptococcus</i></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><i>pneumoniae </i>or <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>infection, which most often results in bacterial pneumonia. Deficits in innate immunity (phagocytes, natural killer cells) and acquired immunity (T-cell function, cytokine activity, antibody response) are all felt to play a role, as discussed in <span style=" color: #0000ED;">Chapter 3</span>.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Presentation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Young, healthy individuals with influenza characteristically present with a sudden onset of fever, cough, myalgia, sore throat, and headache. Fever and cough have been shown in a systematic review to be the best predictors of influenza in the general population. In older adults, however, the presentation may be more subtle with cough and change in baseline temperature predominating. Often, older adults present with worsening of comorbid conditions such as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">heart failure exacerbation. One of the most important factors in making the diagnosis of influenza, whether on clinical grounds or through diagnostic testing, is the local influenza activity. That is, if a community is experiencing an outbreak of influenza, particularly if the incidence of influenza is at its peak, fever and cough in an older person increase the likelihood of infection with influenza. In the nursing home setting, it is essential to obtain prompt diagnostic testing because the clinical presentation is nonspecific. Even when there are peaks of influenza in the community, RSV or other respiratory viruses can circulate. Additionally, an outbreak of influenza in a nursing home warrants chemoprophylaxis (see further discussion) as well as immunization of nonimmunized residents in whom it is safe to do so.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Specific Diagnostic Tests</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The traditional method to detect influenza has been viral culture, which is limited by moderate diagnostic accuracy and delay in obtaining results (<span class="s1">Table 108-1</span>). Rapid tests include direct fluorescent antigen (DFA), or direct immunofluorescence, where monoclonal antibodies labeled with fluorescent material are directed to influenza cell coat antigens. A result can be reported within hours. Rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests are commercially available but are very insensitive in older adults, with sensitivities as low as 20%. Nucleic acid amplification testing, such as RT-PCR, is the most promising test since it is over 95% sensitive and specific and the turnaround time can be rapid. The drawback, however, is that not all laboratories are capable of performing PCR daily.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:63.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 108-1 <span class="s3">■ </span>SUMMARY OF TEST CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR VARIOUS RESPIRATORY VIRAL PATHOGENS IN OLDER ADULTS</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Infection Control Aspects</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The incubation period of influenza, the period of time from initial infection to development of symptoms, is typically 2 days but can range from 1 to 4 days. An infected individual becomes contagious 1 day prior to the onset of symptoms. In adults, viral shedding at levels high enough to cause transmission occurs over 5 or 6 days. The majority of spread of influenza is large droplet caused by coughing and sneezing and hence medical workers should wear a mask to prevent infection and spread. In terms of practical implications, use of “respiratory etiquette,” coughing, and sneezing into tissues, for example, may help prevent spread to older adults who are susceptible to complications, although supporting epidemiologic evidence is limited.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Immunization</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many influenza vaccine formulations are now available in the United States. The most well-known influenza vaccine is the standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated vaccine, abbreviated as SD-IIV4, which contains components of an H1N1, an H3N2, and two B strains.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">For the same reasons that older adults are more likely to have complications due to influenza infection, older adults respond less well to influenza immunizations. A 2014 systematic review summarized 35 influenza vaccine effectiveness studies performed in 15 countries. Cases were influenza positive; controls were patients who also had an acute respiratory illness but who tested negative for influenza. Vaccine effectiveness for the prevention of medically attended acute respiratory illness was found to be 38% to 70% during seasons of vaccine and circulating strain match and 15% to 59% during seasons of mismatch. These data show that influenza immunization plays an important but modest role in prevention.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Due to decreased immune responses and poorer clinical responses when SD-IIV4 is administered in seniors (compared with young adults), enhanced influenza vaccines have been developed and approved for use. A high dose vaccine quadrivalent formulation (HD-IIV4) has four times the dose of each component versus the standard dose. This high dose formulation has been shown to generate higher antibody levels in older adults than SD-IIV4 and is more effective for the prevention of illness and hospitalization due to influenza. The MF59 adjuvanted influenza vaccine, abbreviated aIIV4, also demonstrates increased immunogenicity and effectiveness in older adults</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">compared to the SD-IIV4. Observational studies show MF59 adjuvanted influenza vaccines are associated with reduced hospitalization risk for not only influenza, but also pneumonia and cardiovascular diagnoses—common complications of influenza infection. The quadrivalent, recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) also shows promise in preventing intensive lifestyle intervention in older adults. At this time, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends the use of any of these vaccines in older adults.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Influenza and Long-Term Care</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are at high risk for complications of influenza, including pneumonia, hospitalization, and death. This is likely because there is close contact between residents and staff in these facilities, increasing the exposure to and transmission of influenza, and because the majority of residents have comorbidities, including cognitive impairment, chronic lung disease, and stroke. Outbreaks of influenza are well characterized in nursing homes, often described as “explosive” in that the onset is relatively abrupt. Such outbreaks are usually first detected by nursing home staff who notice a higher incidence of respiratory symptoms than usual on specific units, although at least one surveillance study has shown that such outbreaks are commonly missed even when active surveillance by trained nurses is performed. Such outbreaks are best managed using a multifaceted approach that includes the following: cohorting residents, increasing adherence to hand hygiene, chemoprophylaxis with antiviral agents, and immunization of those not previously vaccinated. It should be noted that because of space and staffing limitations, it is usually not feasible to cohort ill residents together as a means of separating them from noninfected residents in long-term care facilities. Administering neuraminidase inhibitors as chemoprophylaxis to noninfected residents helps to reduce further spread. In one randomized controlled trial where long-term units were randomized to zanamivir or to rimantadine, the risk of influenza was 3% in the zanamivir arm versus 8% in the rimantadine arm (<i>p </i>= 0.038). More recent data suggest that immunizing nursing home staff against influenza benefits residents. There have been four cluster-randomized controlled trials showing that immunizing health care workers against influenza reduces mortality in residents of long-term care facilities. Vaccinating nursing home staff against influenza may prevent influenza-like illness, use of health</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">services, and deaths in nursing home residents, even more so than immunizing residents.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use of Antivirals to Prevent and Treat Influenza in Older Adults in the Community</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are six antivirals that are approved for treating influenza: amantadine (oral), rimantadine (oral), zanamivir (inhaled), oseltamivir (oral), peramivir (IV), and baloxavir marboxil (oral). Amantadine and rimantadine are only active against influenza A, and currently circulating influenza A strains are predominantly resistant to both; their use is no longer recommended. The neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, are active against influenza A and B. They are 70% to 90% effective for prophylaxis in preventing influenza and when used as treatment to reduce clinical severity if given within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, the feasibility of using these agents for treatment is reduced since the majority of patients in the community present over 48 hours following symptom onset. It is important to note that the doses of treatment and prophylaxis are different; hence, it is important to use treatment doses if a patient is symptomatic. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are associated with few adverse effects. Zanamivir may worsen or provoke respiratory distress in those with underlying obstructive disease. Oseltamivir should be dosed based on renal function. In early 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a third neuraminidase inhibitor, peramivir, for the treatment of influenza that is only available in an IV formulation. Baloxavir marboxil, a polymerase inhibitor, was approved in 2018 for treatment of uncomplicated cases of both influenza A and B. Similar to the neuraminidase inhibitors, it must be used within 48 hours of symptom onset. Unfortunately, viruses develop resistance to baloxavir very quickly, limiting its use.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Indirect Benefit of Immunization in Children to Protect Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is observational data to suggest that children play an important role in the spread of influenza in the community. For example, data from a 3-year longitudinal surveillance study of children and adults in New York State demonstrated that children were about twice as likely to acquire and shed influenza compared to adults. In a longitudinal study conducted in Seattle from 1968 to 1974, elementary and junior high school students had the highest rates of influenza during epidemics, reaching 54%. In the Tecumseh,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michigan, studies from 1976 to 1981, over one-third of children between the ages of 5 and 14 had influenza virus isolated from specimens, and the highest rate was among persons with febrile respiratory illness. Serological data revealed similar results; from 1977 to 1978, children in 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 19 age groups had an approximately 30% infection rate with H3N2.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This was over twice the rate seen in adults. There were similar infection rates with influenza B in children aged 5 to 14, rates 14-fold higher than those in adults older than 20 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Given that school-aged children appear to play an important role in introducing and transmitting influenza into households and hence into the community, immunizing these children may interrupt spread to older adults who are at high risk for complications. In the Tecumseh studies, selectively immunizing 86% of children in this 7500-person community with inactivated influenza vaccine reduced influenza in adults by a third when compared to an adjacent community where children were not immunized. More evidence for the potential benefit of immunizing children with inactivated vaccine has been derived from an analysis of the effect of influenza vaccination in Japan. Japan began a program of immunizing school-aged children in 1962 and continued this policy until 1994. The effect of this policy was to dramatically reduce excess mortality rates to values similar to those in the United States.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fact that there was a rapid increase in excess deaths after 1994, the year in which mass immunization formally ended, supports the conclusion that the effects observed in earlier years were because of vaccine-induced herd immunity, although it is possible that social factors may have amplified the effects of this program. The authors explain their findings by hypothesizing that the high levels of vaccination in school children protected transmission of influenza to their grandparents. There have been several more recent observational studies where children have been immunized showing a reduced attack rate of influenza in adults. However, randomized clinical trial evidence of immunizing children to prevent influenza in older adults is limited.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RSV has been long recognized as a major cause of bronchiolitis in children. Since the 1970s, there have been numerous reports about the burden of RSV in older adults, particularly those residing in nursing homes. RSV is now recognized as an important contributor to morbidity in both community-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dwelling older adults as well as in residents of long-term care facilities. This section will describe the epidemiology of RSV in both settings including clinical, diagnostic, and management issues.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Characteristics of Respiratory Syncytial Virus</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RSV is an enveloped RNA virus that can be classified into two major groups, A and B, based on antigenic and genetic properties. An important feature of RSV is that reinfections occur frequently throughout life and into older age. Because RSV infection does not produce robust immunity, developing a vaccine has been a major challenge. In addition, RSV is a very labile virus, meaning it can be difficult to grow if it is not transported carefully, making traditional diagnostic methods such as culture and antigen less sensitive outside of the hospital setting.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Epidemiology</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like influenza, RSV circulates during winter months in temperate climates roughly beginning in October and lasting until early spring. Often, clinical cases precede influenza epidemics. The incubation period of RSV is 3 to 5 days. The majority of those who are infected show respiratory symptoms. In contrast to infants who shed higher titers (10<span class="s22">5–6</span> plaque-forming units/mL of</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">secretion) for longer time periods (10–14 days), adults tend to shed lower titers of the virus (10<span class="s22">2–3</span> plaque-forming units/mL of secretion for 3–6 days). RSV is spread primarily by large droplets and fomites.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Community-Dwelling Older Adults and Respiratory Syncytial Virus <span style=" color: #000;">The best data about RSV in older persons living in the community are</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">derived from a cohort study conducted in Rochester, New York, from 1999 to 2003. This cohort was composed of 608 healthy people aged 65 and older.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forty-six (8%) of the 608 participants developed RSV, compared to 56 (10%) of high-risk older participants (defined as having congestive heart failure or chronic pulmonary disease). The impact of RSV infection was important in both the healthy older adults group and in the high-risk group: 17% and 23%, respectively, of these groups made physician office visits. Morbidity was greater in the high-risk group, where 16% required hospitalization. The study was also useful because it allowed for a comparison to influenza: 42% of healthy older participants and 60% of high- risk participants required office visits for influenza, rates statistically</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">significantly higher than for RSV. Since then, RSV has been shown in other studies to cause similar if not higher hospitalization rates than influenza in older adults.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epidemiology of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Long-Term Care Facilities <span style=" color: #000;">RSV attack rates during nursing home outbreaks have been reported to be variable, ranging from 2% to 90%. However, most involved relatively small numbers of residents and included the use of diagnostic assays with varying levels of sensitivity. In one prospective study conducted in Rochester, where a sensitive enzyme immunoassay was used, the overall attack rate was 7% and the virus was identified as a cause of 27% of illness. One retrospective cohort study estimated the burden of illness in nursing homes in Tennessee by linking cardiopulmonary hospitalization, medical utilization, and death to viral activity in the general community during a period of 88,581 person- years. According to these data, RSV accounted for 15 hospitalizations and 17 deaths per 1000 residents.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Features of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Older Adults</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The clinical features of RSV cannot definitively be distinguished from those of other viruses, though fever is typically less pronounced than for influenza and wheezing more pronounced. The nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation indicates the need for diagnostic testing. Signs and symptoms include rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, and dyspnea.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Similar to patients infected with influenza, patients with RSV may present with exacerbation of underlying conditions.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This can be done by viral culture, antigen detection in respiratory secretions, nucleic acid amplification, or serology. For diagnosis in real time, only the first three tests are appropriate. It is important to note that viral culture is only 50% sensitive. Similarly, detection of RSV antigens using immunofluorescence is very insensitive in older adults. In contrast, RT-PCR is relatively sensitive and specific. As the use of multiplex PCR systems increases, RSV will likely be recognized more often as the causative agent in the clinical setting.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Therapy</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Care is mainly supportive in the older adult with RSV infection. The only licensed antiviral with activity versus RSV is ribavirin, but there are sparse data on which to base treatment recommendations in adults. Practical considerations surrounding ribavirin include that the administration of this aerosolized drug to older adults using face masks may be difficult, and that ribavirin is teratogenic, which is important for the health care provider who is delivering care and the family that is entering the patient’s room.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prevention</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Transmission of RSV is believed to be caused by large droplets and fomites. Strategies such as increasing hand hygiene, particularly in nursing homes, may help to reduce spread. Isolation practices for RSV include gowning and gloving when taking care of a patient with RSV. At the present time, there are no licensed RSV vaccines.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SARS-CoV-2 AND OTHER CORONAVIRUSES</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that are endemic in animals and typically cause mild upper respiratory symptoms in humans, known as “the common cold.” In the past two decades, however, three novel coronaviruses have transitioned from their animal hosts to cause severe disease in humans: SARS-CoV in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the cause of pandemic coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. The COVID- 19 pandemic has had global impact unparalleled in this generation, and like influenza, disproportionately impacts older adults. This section will review SARS-CoV-2 transmission, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and infection control measures.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Characteristics of Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Coronaviruses were named for their spike-like surface projections that resemble a crown. Bats are an important ecological host of coronaviruses and likely serve as reservoirs. Zoonotic transmission—the spread of pathogens from animals to humans—leads to human disease. The virus must first acquire mutations that allow it to begin replicating in human cells. These mutations typically arise randomly in the natural reservoir. Transmission of the virus to a human host can occur directly, via saliva, bites, or through the air, or by way of an intermediate species. Intermediate hosts—palm civets</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for SARS-CoV and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV—contributed to zoonotic transmission of these viruses. There is no conclusive evidence regarding when and where SARS-CoV-2 transitioned to humans. Bats and pangolins have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 as possible zoonotic reservoirs, and it is not known whether an intermediate host was involved. Adaptation to a human host is necessary but not sufficient to cause disease outbreak;</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">human-to-human transmission must also occur.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Transmission of SARS-CoV-2</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor to enter human respiratory epithelial cells and replicates rapidly throughout the respiratory tract. While SARS-CoV and MERS largely reproduce in the lower respiratory tract, high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 are found in the upper respiratory tract. Though SARS-CoV and influenza transmission occur largely after symptoms begin and peak with severity of disease, pharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is highest at the beginning of infection. This means transmission may occur prior to the onset of symptoms and before a person knows they are infected. Transmission through asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases is thought to be a major contributor to pandemic spread, estimated in one study as accounting for up to 79% of documented cases. Its tropism for the upper respiratory tract and asymptomatic spread makes SARS-CoV-2 a highly transmissible pathogen.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Case detection is challenging and spread difficult to prevent without widespread public health measures.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The main mechanism of transmission is via respiratory droplets and airborne particles that are directly inhaled while in close contact with an infected person. It is hypothesized that some people, deemed “super spreaders,” shed more infectious particles in speech and respiratory droplets than others, leading to high numbers of new infections related to large gatherings. Evidence for transmission via droplet contact with the conjunctiva has led to the recommendation for eye protection for all those caring for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Coronaviruses have higher stability than the enveloped influenza virus, including stability on surfaces, and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible. Viable virus has been demonstrated to persist on inanimate surfaces for several days; however, the inoculum required to spread from touching surfaces is not known. Fomites are thus thought to be a possible, though not</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">major source of viral transmission. Though prolonged viral shedding in fecal samples has been demonstrated, there is no evidence for fecal-oral spread of disease at this time.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Features of SARS-CoV-2</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Coronaviruses have a longer incubation period—time from infection to symptom onset—compared to influenza. Various estimates of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 have been proposed. Most recent data estimates symptom onset at around 5 days after infection, with most people demonstrating symptoms within 12 days. There is evidence that older adults experience a longer incubation period, with symptoms typically occurring at 7 days after infection.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms in the majority of cases, to severe respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction, which occur in a small proportion of infections. For those who develop symptoms, fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea are most common. However, atypical presentations are also common, particularly in older adults. One study found that 40% of patients with a mean age of 81 presented with atypical symptoms such as falls, generalized weakness, and delirium. A wide variety of symptoms, including myalgias, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, and loss of sense of smell and/or taste have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other notable clinical features include lymphopenia and other cytopenias, elevated inflammatory markers, and ground-glass opacities on chest imaging in those who develop respiratory symptoms.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Though the majority of cases are mild, the proportion of cases requiring respiratory support is higher than that of 2009 pandemic influenza. It is hypothesized that the rapid replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract can lead to recruitment of inappropriately high levels of pro- inflammatory cytokines and cells, referred to as a “cytokine storm.” This excessive inflammatory response is thought to underlie more severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. While early in the pandemic COVID-19 incidence was highest in adults age 50 and older, the median age of SARS-CoV-2 infection has decreased as testing has become</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">more available to those with asymptomatic or mild cases of infection, who tend to be younger. While all ages are susceptible, severity of disease increases with increasing age. Severe illness occurs in a minority of patients, with the highest rate in those older than 70 years, and is rare in children.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Variable case fatality rates have been reported, largely due to differences in testing; however, fatal illness occurs primarily in those older than 50 years, and up to 80% of deaths from SARS-CoV-2 have been in adults 65 years and older.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Frailty has been proposed as a means to capture the heterogeneity of older adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection and guide decisions regarding prognosis and treatment. One observational cohort study demonstrated an association between frailty, measured using the clinical frailty scale, and 7- day mortality in adults hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, frailty was a better predictor of disease outcome than age or comorbidity alone. In addition to frailty, many common comorbidities are associated with increased risk of severe illness, progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death, including type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, obesity, cancer, and solid organ transplant.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">SARS-CoV-2 is notable for its ability to cause outbreaks in congregate settings. Early outbreaks were reported on several cruise chips and later affected institutions like meat-packing plants, where employees work in close quarters, and college dormitories. Nursing homes, however, have been most critically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The combination of the close quarters of congregate living, a frail population with high personal care needs, and the conditions leading to chronic understaffing and lack of resources for nursing homes created a setting ripe for uncontrolled spread of infection and high mortality. Over a quarter of deaths have occurred in the postacute and long-term care sector, despite accounting for only 2% of the total confirmed cases as of November 2020.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">The impact of physical distancing, loneliness, and social isolation on behavioral health and mortality, particularly for older adults and those who reside in nursing homes, has yet to be fully expounded. In one pre-pandemic study, social isolation, loneliness, and living alone corresponded to an average of 29%, 26%, and 32% increased likelihood of mortality, respectively, in older adults. This is comparable to the risk of unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, alcohol misuse, and smoking. The loss of social</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">interaction may have particular negative consequences for those with dementia.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Though a smaller proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 require hospitalization compared to those with SARS-CoV, as well as to those infected with 2009 pandemic influenza, the overall number of people infected is much higher. This has placed strain on health system resources, at times exceeding hospital and ICU capacity and leading to higher mortality in many areas of the world.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">RT-PCR for detection of viral RNA in a sample from the nasopharynx is the cornerstone of testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to other diagnostic tests, it has the highest sensitivity at early stages of infection, and specificity is also high; however, appropriate sample collection is vital.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Turnaround time ranges from 15 minutes to several days. RT-PCR is time- and labor-intensive and requires a well-equipped laboratory, which also impacts turnaround time, particularly for facilities like nursing homes and rural hospitals that must send tests to a central laboratory.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Development of point-of-care (POC) testing has been a priority during the pandemic in order to provide rapid results that can guide clinical management, allocation of personal protective equipment (PPE), and activation of isolation protocols. Currently available POC devices automate multiple steps of lab-based immunoassay methods to detect viral antigens in nasal specimens in under an hour. Sensitivity is lower than RT-PCR, particularly early in the course of infection, with high specificity; however, these devices have been tested and received authorization for use on symptomatic persons only, and test characteristics for screening and testing asymptomatic persons are unknown.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">While there is no role for serologic testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV- 2 in diagnosing active infection, the immunology of SARS-CoV-2, including the course of antibody production and protection against future infection, is an active area of study.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated an exceptional period of research and development of not only diagnostics but also a myriad of potential therapeutics. Several medications have shown benefit in specific</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">populations—for example, the steroid dexamethasone reduces mortality in hospitalized patients requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation, though confers no benefit in those not requiring respiratory support. Though several have been approved for emergency use in the United States, antivirals and monoclonal antibodies, as well as convalescent plasma, have yet to be evaluated in phase 3 trials; availability is also limited, and expense high, for these treatments. Hundreds of drugs continue in development or clinical trials; however, no treatment has demonstrated general prophylactic or therapeutic benefit against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Infection Control Aspects of the COVID-19 Pandemic</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Without broadly effective therapeutics, infection control measures are paramount in mitigating the adverse health outcomes of the pandemic. Basic measures including hand hygiene and masks to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets, identical to those recommended for other respiratory viruses including influenza, have been demonstrated to reduce transmission. Cities and states across the United States also implemented restrictions on public gatherings to encourage social distancing and limit the spread of infection.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">As discussed in a previous section, rapid, accurate, and readily available diagnostic tests are essential to identifying cases and isolating infected patients. SARS-CoV was mitigated in part due to rigorous contact tracing and case isolation measures, and countries able to implement similarly robust public health measures were able to rapidly control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Gaps in diagnostics exist, most notably accurate tests for screening asymptomatic persons to identify those in the incubation phase of infection. Detection of these cases is critical to control asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Nursing home best practices have developed to include regular testing of staff and residents along with appropriate PPE and hand hygiene. Increases in nursing home cases and deaths are associated with increases of cases in the community, and staff testing frequencies are based on community positivity rates. Contract tracing and isolation of positive residents, as well as cohorting staff so that different groups care for positive and negative residents, are ideal but often unattainable due to staffing and resource limitations in this setting.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">In addition to limiting spread of infection, a crucial approach to pandemic mitigation is to reduce the number of susceptible people via immunization. Promising vaccine candidates have demonstrated more than 90% effectiveness in preventing infection, and immunization can also have a role in reducing transmission and attenuating illness. Large-scale production and global vaccine deployment remain an ongoing challenge in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Concerns about emerging coronaviruses have been growing even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The global experience of encountering a novel virus with pandemic spread and an impact far beyond health care has highlighted the need for ongoing research into emerging infectious diseases. The need for coordinated international response and cooperation, not only in combating the COVID-19 pandemic but also in preparing for future pandemics, has become more evident than ever.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Darvishian M, Bijlsma MF, Hak E, van den Heuvel ER.
