Many chronic conditions are risk factors for disability, including cardiovascular disease, heart failure, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cancer, depression, dementia, and sensory impairments. Moreover, the presence and burden of disability and functional limitations increases notably with the number of chronic conditions ( Figure 2-15 ).

Findings of a meta- analysis involving over 20 population-based prospective studies supported an increased risk of AD in patients with a history of late-life depression (pooled risk OR [95% CI] 1.65 [1.42–1.92]). To date, the precise mechanisms underlying the association between depression and enhanced AD risk are unknown. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed that are common to both AD and depression, including elevated levels of cytokin...
