<h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PLASMA CELL DISORDERS</h2><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plasma cell disorders (PCDs) encompass a range of clonal conditions, ranging from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is by definition asymptomatic and requires no treatment, through multiple myeloma, wherein the clonal plasma cells cause end-organ damage, require therapy, and will ultimately cause the patient’s death if left untreated. The incidence of PCDs increases with age, and the presence of multimorbidity may make it a challenge to distinguish between end-organ damage (ie, anemia, renal insufficiency, or vertebral compression fractures) related to a PCD versus another underlying comorbid condition. <span class="s1">Table 95-14 </span>summarizes key aspects of the PCDs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#762184;display:block;min-height:45.0pt;width:457.5pt;"><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TABLE 95-14 <span class="s3">■ </span>PLASMA CELL DISORDERS: DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</p></div><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Laboratory Evaluation</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PCDs are among the few neoplasms where routine laboratory testing other than tissue biopsy can detect the “fingerprint” of a clonal population, in this case detection of a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. This protein may be referred to as a paraprotein, M-component/M-spike or restricted peak. The monoclonal protein may be an intact immunoglobulin (comprising</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">both heavy and light chains), light chain only or, rarely, heavy chain only. Advances in laboratory technology have allowed more sensitive and specific detection and identification of a paraprotein and have improved our ability to monitor response to treatment in those PCDs that require treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Serum protein electrophoresis </span>In serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), the serum proteins are separated by an electric field on an agarose gel and stained with Amido black, and quantitated by densitometer tracing of the gel. An alternate, more sensitive SPEP method, involves separation of serum proteins in a capillary tube in a liquid phase buffer by a high-voltage current and quantitation by light absorbance. The latter mechanism is more accurate as it does not rely on uptake of dye. Monoclonal proteins are named for the protein region in which they migrated, such as α<span class="s11">1</span>, α<span class="s11">2</span>, β, or γ (eg, “γ-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">restricted peak”).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Serum immunofixation <span class="p">Immunofixation is more sensitive than is SPEP, allowing for confirmation of monoclonality and determination of the type of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain class of the involved protein.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, it is purely qualitative and does not allow quantitation. In this test, the separated serum proteins are tested with specific antibodies (eg, anti-γ, anti-μ, anti-α, anti-κ, anti-λ) and stained.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Urine protein electrophoresis <span class="p">Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) is performed in a similar manner as described for SPEP. It allows quantitation of the types of protein found in the urine. Generally the percentage of each type of protein is reported, allowing distinction between proteinuria caused primarily by albumin versus light chain production. Coupled with the total amount of protein in a 24-hour urine collection, this allows quantitation of the total amount of monoclonal protein eliminated in the urine.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Urine immunofixation <span class="p">Urine immunofixation, like serum immunofixation, is more sensitive for the presence of a paraprotein. Given that only the light chains are freely filtered at the glomerulus, generally only kappa or lambda light chains are detected on immunofixation of the urine, though occasionally heavy chain fragments are detectable. Urine immunofixation is a qualitative test only.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Serum-fre e light chain assay <span class="p">The serum-free light chain is a quantitative measure of excess kappa or lambda light chains produced by a plasma cell clone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under normal circumstances, a slight excess of light chains is produced relative to heavy chains in the production of intact immunoglobulins,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">resulting in small quantities of kappa and lambda light chains free in the serum. The ratio of kappa to lambda light chains is roughly 1:1, with the normal range of ratios of kappa to lambda ranging from 0.26 to 1.65. In a clonal PCD, the ratio will either be greater than the upper limit of normal with a kappa paraprotein, or less than the lower limit of normal with a lambda paraprotein. Notably, as the light chains are renally cleared, the absolute level of kappa and lambda light chains may be elevated in patients with renal impairment, but the ratio will remain close to normal.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Definition </span>MGUS is an asymptomatic premalignant condition characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. The 2014 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria defined that a diagnosis of MGUS requires a total serum M-component less than 30 g/L, with bone marrow plasma cells (or lymphoplasmacytic cells in the case of an IgM paraprotein) less than 10% and no end-organ damage related to the monoclonal protein (eg, “CRAB” criteria: hyper<i>c</i>alcemia, <i>r</i>enal insufficiency, <i>a</i>nemia, or <i>b</i>one lesions) or amyloidosis (see <span class="s1">Table 95-14</span>).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology <span class="p">The prevalence of MGUS in the United States is approximately 3% and ranges from 1% to 5% in other countries throughout the world. It increases in prevalence with age, and is more common in men and African- Americans. Additional risk factors include having a primary relative with a history of MGUS or myeloma, exposure to pesticides, rural residence, and possibly obesity.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathophysiology (classification) <span class="p">MGUS may be classified as IgG, IgA, light chain MGUS, or IgM MGUS. MGUS may progress to multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, or primary amyloidosis. IgM MGUS generally does not progress to multiple myeloma, but to Waldenström macroglobulinemia or amyloidosis. The rate of progression to symptomatic myeloma is about 1% per year; high-, high-intermediate, low-intermediate, and low-risk groups are defined based on the type of monoclonal protein, level of the M-spike, and whether the serum-free light chain ratio is normal.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">MGUS may be discovered when the patient is undergoing evaluation for another disorder and is found to have a monoclonal protein. This may include evaluation for anemia, renal insufficiency, proteinuria,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">osteoporosis or fractures, hypergammaglobulinemia, or peripheral neuropathy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation <span class="p">The identification of a monoclonal protein requires evaluation for the presence of end-organ damage. The history and physical examination should focus on symptoms suggestive of CRAB criteria. A CBC should be obtained to rule out anemia; a basic metabolic panel estimates renal function and rules out hypercalcemia. In the presence of concomitant explanations for anemia (eg, iron deficiency) or renal insufficiency (eg, established diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy with stable renal function), the criterion for end- organ damage is not satisfied. Finally, bone imaging is required. The traditional skeletal survey is being replaced by more sensitive bone imaging, including 15-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (either whole body or spine), or low- dose whole-body computed tomography (CT).</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management <span class="p">MGUS does not require treatment. Patients identified as having MGUS are followed at 6- to 12-month intervals for progression to a malignant disorder, with monitoring for anemia, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, or bone lesions.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smoldering Myeloma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition <span class="p">Smoldering myeloma is intermediate between MGUS and symptomatic multiple myeloma, defined as the presence of an IgG or IgA monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 30 g/L or urinary monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 500 mg per 24 hours and/or clonal bone marrow plasma cells 10% to 60%. End-organ damage related to the paraprotein (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions, or amyloidosis) must be absent.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathophysiology (classification) <span class="p">Only 50% of patients with smoldering myeloma progress to require therapy in 5 years (10% risk per year), and 30% are free of progression to myeloma at 10 years. Because of this heterogeneity, subgroups of patients at highest risk for progression from smoldering to overt myeloma were identified, in order to not subject the patient to end-organ damage before initiation of treatment. About 90% of patients with more than 60% plasma cells in their bone marrow progress to multiple myeloma requiring treatment within 2 years, leading to the recent change in myeloma diagnostic criteria: These patients previously diagnosed with smoldering</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">myeloma are now categorized as having multiple myeloma requiring treatment.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation <span class="p">Evaluation should be as for MGUS earlier, but also requires a bone marrow biopsy to determine the percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow. As with MGUS, bone imaging such as whole-body CT, PET-CT, or whole body MRI to detect lytic lesions is required</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic <span class="p">Patients with smoldering myeloma should be followed at 3- to 6-month intervals for history and physical examination and laboratory evaluation including CBCs, a basic metabolic profile, and quantitation of the monoclonal protein.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drugs <span class="p">Previously, only observation was recommended for patients with smoldering myeloma. Data are emerging demonstrating a benefit to treatment with the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide in individuals with intermediate or high-risk smoldering myeloma, with delay of progression to myeloma and the development of myeloma-related end organ damage.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multiple Myeloma</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition <span class="p">Multiple myeloma is the malignant clonal proliferation of plasma cells with related end-organ damage, including hypercalcemia caused by lytic bone lesions, anemia, and renal insufficiency, which may be caused by hypercalcemia or light chain nephropathy.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology <span class="p">Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy, with an estimated 34,920 new diagnoses in 2021 in the United States. Current evidence supports the fact that all cases of multiple myeloma are preceded by MGUS. As with MGUS, male gender, African-American race, and advancing age are all associated with increased incidence of multiple myeloma. With the aging of the population, there will be a 57% increase in the incidence of myeloma, and more strikingly, a 77% increase in the incidence of myeloma in people older than age 65.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">The most common presenting symptom is bone pain, present in three out of five patients. Back pain is generally of less than 1 year in duration. Fatigue is present in one-third of patients. Other symptoms may include altered mental status or constipation due to hypercalcemia, recurrent infections, or weight loss. Patients who have developed cord compression</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">may present with paresis. Some patients may present with abnormal laboratory findings alone, including anemia, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, or an elevated total serum protein level with hypoalbuminemia (an elevated “protein gap”).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Evaluation </span>Evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, seeking evidence of end-organ damage. Examination may reveal pallor, indicative of anemia, kyphosis related to vertebral compression fractures, or mental status changes due to hypercalcemia. Laboratory evaluation includes CBCs, comprehensive metabolic profile, serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, quantitative immunoglobulins, serum-free light chains, lactate dehydrogenase, and β<span class="s11">2</span>-microglobulin. Radiographic evaluation begins with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">advanced bone imaging, such as low-dose whole body CT, PET-CT, or whole body MRI. Skeletal survey alone is no longer considered adequate for detection of myeloma bone lesions. Notably, nuclear medicine bone scans are generally negative in multiple myeloma, given that myeloma bone lesions are purely lytic. Finally, pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis is obtained with bone marrow core biopsy and aspirate. The bone marrow aspirate is also sent for cytogenetics and FISH for chromosomal abnormalities commonly seen in multiple myeloma.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Pathophysiology (classification) </span>The current staging system used for multiple myeloma is the Revised-International Staging System. This system, replacing the older Durie-Salmon staging system and its precursor International Staging System, requires the serum albumin, β<span class="s11">2</span>-microglobulin, and lactate</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dehydrogenase levels as well as the presence or absence of higher risk chromosomal abnormalities, including t4;14, t14;16, and del 17p.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management <span class="p">The management of multiple myeloma in older adults can be complex.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic <span class="p">As a systemic disease, multiple myeloma essentially categorically requires systemic therapy. However, radiation or surgery may have a role in the management of skeletal lesions or the oncologic emergency spinal cord compression. Patients who present with cord compression may undergo surgical decompression followed by radiation with a goal of preserving or restoring function. Patients who present with pathologic fractures or lesions of the long bones at risk for pathologic fracture may undergo surgical stabilization to preserve or restore function; such lesions</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are generally irradiated postoperatively to facilitate healing and decrease pain. Other painful bone lesions may be irradiated for pain relief.</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drugs <span class="p">The therapeutic options for multiple myeloma have improved dramatically in the past 20 years, resulting in a near-doubling of the average overall survival times. For adults aged 65 to 74, the 5-year survival rate improved from 27% in 1998 to 2004 to 39% in 2005 to 2009 then to 48% in 2010 to 2014. For adults aged 75 to 90, the 5-year survival rate improved from 16% in 1998 to 2004 to 23% in 2005 to 2009 then to 31% in 2010 to 2014. Continued advances promise continuing improvement in the duration of survival.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Melphalan. <span class="p">For over three decades, oral melphalan was the standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma. When melphalan is combined with prednisone, about 50% of patients will have at least a partial response to therapy. The main toxicity of melphalan is myelosuppression. Melphalan is still used in some regimens for older adults, but has largely been supplanted by newer more effective treatment options.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Corticos teroids . </span>Corticosteroids are incorporated into essentially every antimyeloma regimen. Corticosteroids have rapid direct antimyeloma efficacy and act synergistically with other agents. Corticosteroids are often used when patients present acutely and highly symptomatically with a new diagnosis of multiple myeloma. High-dose corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone 40 mg orally × 4 days) can be used to rapidly ameliorate hypercalcemia or significant bone pain. However, corticosteroid dosing should be chosen cautiously for longer-term management. In a randomized trial of lenalidomide with high-dose versus low-dose dexamethasone (lenalidomide plus dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1–4, 9–12, and 17– 20 [RD] versus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone 40 mg weekly), RD was associated with a higher response rate but <i>poorer overall survival </i>due to increased toxicity (primarily venous thromboembolic events and infections). Thus, high-dose corticosteroids should be avoided in older patients due to increased risk of treatment-related mortality. Further, a recent randomized trial demonstrated that in intermediate-fit older adults, discontinuation of steroids after the first 9 months of the initial therapy resulted in superior event-free survival, indicating less toxicity with preserved antimyeloma efficacy. Similar studies have not been conducted in the setting of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">relapsed/refractory myeloma, and steroids remain an anchor in the treatment of myeloma.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thalidomide. <span class="p">The antimyeloma efficacy of the immunomodulatory agent thalidomide was first reported in 1999, heralding a revolution in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Over the first decade of the new century, thalidomide was utilized in a number of combinations, including with melphalan and prednisone (MPT) and bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMPT). The toxicities of thalidomide include sedation, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, and venous thromboembolic events. It is used less frequently now in preference for more effective and less toxic options.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lenalidomide. <span class="p">Lenalidomide, another immunomodulatory agent, has largely supplanted thalidomide due to improved tolerability and efficacy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lenalidomide’s toxicities include venous thromboembolism and cytopenias. A randomized trial demonstrated that continuous lenalidomide with dexamethasone improves progression-free and overall survival over MPT or lenalidomide and dexamethasone of a fixed duration (18 months), establishing this regimen as a standard of care in older adults with multiple myeloma. Dose must be adjusted for renal insufficiency.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pomalidomide. <span class="p">Pomalidomide is approved in the United States for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have previously been treated with bortezomib and lenalidomide.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bortezomib. <span class="p">Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor administered parenterally for initial therapy or at relapse. It was initially administered intravenously and twice weekly, a regimen which was found to be excessively toxic in older adults. Once-weekly subcutaneous administration of bortezomib is tolerated much better in older adults, with similar efficacy. The main toxicities of bortezomib are peripheral neuropathy, cytopenias, and herpes zoster. Bortezomib is administered in combination with dexamethasone, and may be used in combination with another agent, such as lenalidomide or cyclophosphamide. Bortezomib does not require dose adjustment for renal impairment.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carfilzomib. <span class="p">Carfilzomib is the second-in-class proteasome inhibitor, approved in the United States for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received bortezomib and an immunomodulatory</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">agent (either lenalidomide or thalidomide). Its toxicities include cytopenias and dyspnea. Cardiotoxicity is an increasingly recognized adverse effect of particular concern in older adults.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ixazomib. <span class="p">Ixazomib is an orally administered proteasome inhibitor with efficacy and toxicity similar to bortezomib. It is approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed myeloma, but there is interest in its use in the initial therapy setting, particularly for older adults.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monoclonal antibodies . <span class="p">Elotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against SLAMF7, a marker found on both selected normal hematopoietic cells and myeloma cells. It is approved for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed myeloma. Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD38, present on plasma cells. It is available in both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations, with its main toxicities being infusion reactions and risk of infection. It is approved for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for older adults who will not be undergoing stem cell transplant, as well as in the relapsed setting.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combination regimens . <span class="p">Numerous combinations of the above agents have been examined in clinical trials. Generally, combination regimens result in higher response rates, but also in greater toxicity; whether the combination improves outcomes like overall survival depends on the balance of efficacy and toxicity. The IMWG recommends that older adults with multiple myeloma deemed more frail receive either well-tolerated three-drug combinations or only two-drug combinations (lenalidomide and dexamethasone).</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">High-dos e therapy and autologous s tem cell trans plantation. <span class="p">Select, fit older</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adults, generally under age 75 but occasionally older, may be candidates for high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Even with the tremendous advances in treatment, the approach of induction therapy, high- dose therapy/autologous stem cell transplant, followed by maintenance therapy, continues to produce the longest durations of myeloma control of all therapeutic options.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Emerging therapies . <span class="p">The entire wealth of emerging treatments, either approved in relapsed settings or still investigational, is beyond the scope of this chapter. Among the newest options approved are selinexor, belantamab</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mafodotin-blmf, isatuximab, and melphalan flufenamide. A paucity of data on the toxicity of the newest drugs in older patients presents a challenge for clinicians and patients considering these approaches. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells are a still-investigational approach expected to emerge in practice in 2021.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prevention of complications</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Skeletal-Related Events <span class="p">Intravenous bisphosphonates are effective for primary or secondary prevention of skeletal-related events (including pathologic fractures or painful lytic lesions requiring radiation). Zoledronic acid and pamidronate are utilized in the United States. Denosumab, the RANK ligand inhibitor, is approved for patients with multiple myeloma and utilized in patients with renal impairment in whom bisphosphonates are contraindicated.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Infection Prophylaxis <span class="p">Patients with multiple myeloma should receive the pneumococcal vaccine and annual influenza vaccinations. Patients receiving certain treatments should receive herpes zoster prophylaxis with acyclovir or valacyclovir. One randomized trial demonstrated a reduction in fever or early death in patients treated with levofloxacin for the first 3 months after diagnosis.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Special issues</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frailty <span class="p">Given that the majority of patients with myeloma are older than age 65, there has been great interest in developing an easily implemented measure of frailty. The International Myeloma Working Group developed a frailty score based on age greater than 80, dependence in ADL/IADL, and comorbidities that predict toxicity of therapy and survival. Studies selecting patients based on their frailty level (fit, intermediate, or frail) or adjusting treatment based on the same are emerging and underway, promising improved means to tailor treatment to the health of older adults.</span></p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Comorbidity <span class="p">The presence of comorbidities is prognostic in older adults with multiple myeloma. Comorbidities may also limit treatment options or influence the rates of toxicity. For example, underlying peripheral neuropathy may limit the use of bortezomib. Diabetes may limit the dose of corticosteroids due to hyperglycemia. Patients and clinicians may have concerns about using carfilzomib in the presence of underlying cardiac disease given risk for dyspnea.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Solitary Plasmacytomas</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">Definition </span>Solitary plasmacytomas are malignant proliferations of plasma cells located either in bone or soft tissue, in the absence of other evidence of end- organ damage, and with no or minimal (&lt; 10%) plasma cells in the bone marrow (see <span class="s1">Table 95-14</span>).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology <span class="p">Plasmacytomas are a relatively rare PCD, with an incidence rate of 0.34 cases per 100,000 person-years. Similar to multiple myeloma, plasmacytomas are more common among males and those of Black race.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">Solitary plasmacytomas of bone occur most commonly in the axial skeleton, including the vertebrae or pelvis. Solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas occur most commonly in the upper aerodigestive tract, including the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oral cavity, or sinuses. Presentation is generally related to local symptoms of the mass.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation <span class="p">Evaluation of plasmacytomas proceeds as the evaluation for multiple myeloma, with the goal of ruling out multiple myeloma.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management</p><p class="s248" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nonpharmacologic <span class="p">The treatment for solitary plasmacytoma is radiation therapy, with curative intent. Radiation is highly effective at establishing local control of the plasmacytoma, and relapses within the radiation field are unusual. If the patient experiences recurrence, it is generally progression to multiple myeloma rather than a local recurrence or persistence of the plasmacytoma.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drugs <span class="p">Systemic therapy as for multiple myeloma is utilized in the setting of a radiation-refractory solitary plasmacytoma or progression to multiple myeloma.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primary Amyloidosis</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definition <span class="p">Amyloidosis is a heterogenous group of rare disorders characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in soft tissues. Nearly 30 different amyloidogenic proteins have been implicated; herein we focus exclusively on AL amyloidosis, where a monoclonal PCD results in the formation of amyloidogenic kappa or lambda light chains.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epide miology <span class="p">AL amyloidosis is extremely rare, with only 10 patients diagnosed per 1,000,000 person-years. It coexists with multiple myeloma in 10% of cases.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentation <span class="p">Presenting symptoms may be diverse given the range of organs potentially involved in AL amyloidosis. Symptoms may include fatigue,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dyspnea, edema, or neuropathy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluation <span class="p">History may reveal fatigue, dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea suggestive of heart failure, lower extremity edema, or paresthesias or abnormal bruising. Examination may reveal periorbital purpura, macroglossia, signs of heart failure, hepatosplenomegaly, ecchymosis, or sensory neuropathy. Laboratory evaluation includes CBCs and a comprehensive metabolic profile, serum and urine electrophoresis, and immunofixation and serum-free light chain assay. A 24-hour urine collection for electrophoresis will demonstrate that proteinuria is largely albuminuria rather than light chain excretion. A bone marrow biopsy may demonstrate a small clonal plasma cell population and amyloid deposition.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Echocardiography or cardiac MRI may demonstrate evidence of cardiac involvement. Serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin-T levels are prognostic and should be obtained. A periumbilical fat pad aspiration may provide the patient with pathologic confirmation of amyloid deposition without subjecting the patient to a more invasive endomyocardial, renal, or hepatic biopsy.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pathophysiology (classification) <span class="p">Distinguishing AL amyloidosis from other forms of amyloidosis can be challenging; a monoclonal protein may coexist with another form of amyloid. Amyloid typing can be accomplished through direct immunofluorescence microscopy or immunohistochemistry. Staging is based on NT-proBNP levels, troponin-T levels, and serum-free light chain levels.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cardiac involvement portends a particularly poor prognosis, with a median survival of fewer than 6 months in patients with elevated cardiac markers and involved serum light chains. In patients with no high-risk factors, the median survival is nearly 8 years.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management <span class="p">Management of AL amyloidosis is essentially entirely pharmacologic. There is no role for surgery or radiation aside from skeletal issues if there is overlap with multiple myeloma. Treatment is directed at the malignant plasma cell clone. A small minority of patients is eligible for high- dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation and may experience complete responses and long-term survival (&gt; 10 years). The systemic therapeutic options utilized in multiple myeloma have activity in amyloidosis, though some require lower doses for tolerability.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The PCDs share in common a clonal proliferation of plasma cells, which are detectable via a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. MGUS is a premalignant, asymptomatic laboratory finding, which progresses to a malignant disorder at a rate of 1% per year. Solitary plasmacytomas are potentially curable with radiation therapy. Multiple myeloma remains an incurable plasma cell malignancy, but therapeutic options have substantially improved in the past two decades. Amyloidosis remains a therapeutic challenge, though improved risk stratification and the use of novel agents developed in myeloma are improving the landscape.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p class="s258" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FURTHER READING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Coiffier B, Lepage E, Briere J, et al.
